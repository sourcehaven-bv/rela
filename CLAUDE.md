## Rules for new code

- **Define interfaces at the call site, not next to the implementation.**
  Producer-side interfaces couple consumers to every method the producer
  exposes. Each consumer declares the minimum interface it needs (one to
  three methods). When a callback would create a constructor cycle, the
  consumer defines the narrow interface and the wiring site supplies it —
  see `docs/architecture/consumer-side-interfaces.md` and the godoc on
  `autocascade.Host`, `mcp.GraphReader`, `scheduler.WorkspaceProvider`.
- **Capability bundles, not service locators.** When a subsystem needs
  several collaborators, group them in a purpose-specific struct (see
  `internal/lua/deps.go` with `ReadDeps` / `WriteDeps`), split by read vs.
  write so read-only code can't accidentally mutate state. A scoped
  consumer-side `Services` interface is fine (see `internal/mcp/server.go`);
  a cross-subsystem grab-bag is not.
- **No repository or transaction abstractions.** Depend directly on
  `store.Store`, `tracer.Tracer`, `search.Searcher`,
  `entitymanager.Manager`. The old `repo` and `tx` layers are gone
  — do not reintroduce equivalents. The one sanctioned transaction seam
  is `store.Store.Tx` itself (DEC-8UIL0): a contract ON the store with
  per-backend meaning (fs/mem: write mutex, mutual exclusion only;
  postgres: native transaction + advisory lock, rollback, events at
  commit) — not a generic unit-of-work layer stacked above it. Don't
  wrap `Tx` in a new abstraction, and don't do slow external I/O inside
  a `Tx` callback.
- **Capture state once per operation.** Call `ws.Snapshot()` (or the
  equivalent `appState.Load()`) at the top of every handler, command, MCP
  tool, or observer; reuse the returned value for every read in that
  operation. Do not call `ws.Graph()` / `ws.Meta()` repeatedly — multiple
  loads against the underlying `atomic.Pointer` can observe different
  snapshots if a reload lands between them.
- **Don't leak storage or parsing types via return values.** A function
  that returns `*markdown.Document`, `*graph.Graph`, `interface{}`, or any
  type whose package the caller wouldn't otherwise need pulls the
  implementation into every consumer. Return value types or
  domain-package DTOs (`entity.Entity`, `entity.Relation`, `tracer.Result`).
  If you reach for `interface{}` plus a type assertion as a back-channel,
  define a typed dependency instead.
- **Split state-publish from write-serialize.** Use `atomic.Pointer[State]`
  for publishing a new state snapshot (no reader lock, no torn reads) and
  a separate `sync.Mutex` for serializing writers. Do not combine both
  responsibilities into a single `sync.RWMutex` — the lock-upgrade dance
  (`RUnlock → Lock → defer(Unlock → RLock)`) is the symptom, not the fix.
- **Constructors reject nil required fields.** A `New*` function with
  required collaborators returns `error` and validates them up front.
  Never substitute a no-op or sentinel implementation silently — that
  defers the failure to a downstream symptom that is much harder to
  diagnose.
- **Restrictions compile at LOAD time; the evaluator has no denial
  primitive.** Client attenuation (`client_baselines` / `scope_grants`,
  TKT-IAC8TX) restricts a client below the user it acts as, but it does so
  by compiling into plain allowlists when `acl.yaml` loads — `redact:
  {person: [salary]}` becomes "person's permitted fields, minus salary".
  `decideFromAttrs`, `readQuery`, `grantsPermission` and `FieldVerdicts`
  keep seeing allowlists, so DEC-RG878's additive union semantics are
  intact. **Do not add a runtime deny.** `ReadQuery` compiles to a
  `store.GraphQuery` pushed into SQL, so a runtime denial would have to
  become a SQL predicate in every backend, and every evaluation path plus
  all of `internal/aclmap` would need re-deriving.

  The clamp point is `Request.roleFor` — every evaluation path resolves
  role names through it, so reaching into `policy.Roles[...]` directly
  from a new path silently bypasses the ceiling. A guard test
  (`ceilingguard_test.go`) scans the package and fails on that; it uses an
  exemption list, so a new file must be clean or explicitly exempted.

  A ceiling only ever NARROWS (`effective = user_grants ∩ (baseline ∪
  scopes)`), so a bug fails toward less access — except in the compilation
  step, which is why that has direct unit tests rather than only
  end-to-end ones.

  **What this rule does NOT forbid**: adding a new allowlist DIMENSION to
  the compiled result. The prohibition is on subtractive evaluation — a
  `deny` the evaluator applies per row — not on the query carrying more
  allowlists. `ReadQueryResult` already carries a type verdict and a
  composed `GraphQuery`; a per-face allowlist (TKT-FACEREAD) is the same
  shape: computed from grants at compile time, pushed down as an
  additional predicate, still additive. It costs one predicate per
  backend, not a re-derivation of the evaluator.
- **Read-out paths go through visibility wrappers, base readers stay
  ungated.** Read-side ACL (entity row-gating + field-level `visible:`
  redaction) is enforced by `internal/visibility` decorators
  (`Reader`, the tracer decorator) injected at the wiring site — never
  by per-consumer redaction calls, and never inside `store`/`tracer`/
  `search` themselves (DEC-ZBI39P; the `search.VisibleSearcher`
  pattern generalized). **Row-level**: a hidden entity is nonexistent —
  pruned subtrees, withheld paths, a denied GET indistinguishable from a
  real 404 (whether an entity *exists* is a genuine secret). **Field-level**
  (`visible:`): redaction hides property **values only** — it makes no claim
  to conceal *which* properties exist, since the metamodel (declared property
  names per type) is served over the API. A "field-existence oracle" is not a
  threat this guards against; code need not contort to hide field names, only
  their values. A system job that may read
  everything gets an `AllowAllReader` capability at wiring while
  keeping its genuine `system:*` principal for audit — allow-all is
  never inferred from identity. Write-prep reads (entitymanager
  diffing) keep raw store access: a redacted read-modify-write would
  clobber hidden fields.
- **Aggregates computed over the graph gate BEFORE they fold.** The gantt
  endpoint (`internal/dataentry/gantt_handler.go`, TKT-MW28U5) pins the
  pattern: row-gate the node set, redact each entity ONCE, then run the
  roll-up fold, then compute caps/`truncated` — all on the filtered tree.
  The `_views` pipeline's traverse-raw-then-redact-on-the-way-out order is
  safe for flat collections but NOT for an aggregate: folding raw values
  launders a hidden entity's dates into a visible parent's rolled span (a
  value disclosure, not the accepted one-bit membership channel), and a
  pre-filter count or truncation flag is an existence oracle
  (`TestGantt_ACLRollupExcludesHiddenChild`, `TestGantt_TruncatedIsPostFilter`).
  Any new derived-over-subtree value (sums, progress %, counts) follows the
  same order, and the result is per-principal — never cache it across
  principals. `visibility.Redact` is non-composable (raw store entities in,
  exactly once), so the redaction point stays single.
- **Partial writes go through `entitymanager.Manager.PatchEntity`, never
  read-modify-write.** Name the properties you are changing in an
  `entity.Patch` (`Properties` upserts, `MetaUnset` removes, `Content` is a
  `*string` tri-state) and the manager merges them against the raw stored
  entity internally. Properties you do not name are preserved — **forgetting
  one is a no-op, not an erasure.**

  The alternative — `GetEntity` → clone → merge → `UpdateEntity` — requires
  holding the *whole* entity, so anything you failed to carry across is
  destroyed on save. That is unrecoverable when the read was redacted: a
  caller who cannot see a property cannot carry it, and silently deletes it.
  This used to be guarded by prose and a raw `lua.ReadDeps.WritePrepStore`
  handle; TKT-80EWGM removed both, so the mistake is now unavailable rather
  than merely discouraged. Pinned by `TestPatchEntity_PreservesUnnamedProperties`
  and `TestScriptReads_UpdatePreservesHiddenProperties`.

  `UpdateEntity` still exists for callers that legitimately own the whole
  entity (a form save that renders every field). `ApplyEntity` is the
  whole-record replace the sync channel needs. If you are writing a *subset*,
  you want `PatchEntity`.
- **Background jobs: the queue knows nothing about schedules, and never
  runs before a transaction closes.** External side effects (mail, HTTP, AI)
  belong on `jobs.Queue` rather than inline on a write path. Two rules keep
  the seam usable:

  *Retry is a flat enum* (`RetryNever` / `RetryBounded` / `RetryPersistent`),
  plus an optional deadline and idempotency key — nothing else. The enum names
  INTENT; mechanism (attempt counts, backoff, the `RetryPersistent` outer
  bound) lives in `internal/jobs/retry.go` and is meant to be retuned there for
  everyone. Do NOT widen it into a policy struct or add per-call knobs: a call
  site needing different mechanics is evidence for a new intent value.

  *A recurring task uses `IdempotencyKey`, never a cadence-derived
  `Deadline`.* A key says "one of these pending at a time is enough", so a run
  that is still queued suppresses the next rather than stacking a second copy
  — a daily report delayed six hours must not then send twice. A deadline
  expresses something different: "this is worthless after T", which makes the
  job VANISH when it cannot start in time. Under load that drops scheduled
  work precisely when the operator most wants it done, and (before the guard
  existed) hung the scheduler on a completion that never arrived. Deadlines
  are for work whose value genuinely expires; schedules are not that.

  *A job enqueued inside `store.Store.Tx` must not become runnable until that
  transaction commits.* Otherwise a worker reads it on another connection
  that cannot see the uncommitted writes and acts on the pre-write world — a
  race that passes tests and fails under load. `jobs.WithDeferral` collects
  enqueues; the transaction seam calls `Flush` on commit or `Discard` on
  rollback, mirroring pgstore's `txPending`. Pinned by `jobstest`.

  The fs/desktop tier is EPHEMERAL on purpose — jobs vanish on exit, because
  an unsent mail from an ended session is not worth resurrecting. Don't
  "fix" it to persist; that is what the postgres tier is for.

  *The durable queue's tables live in the TENANT's schema, like every other
  postgres-backed table.* A schema-pinned `search_path` is how rela scopes a
  tenant, and the queue is not exempt: rela submits every kind to one queue
  name and neoq's insert trigger does `pg_notify(NEW.queue, ...)`, so tables
  shared across tenants would mean tenants consuming each other's jobs. neoq
  v0.72.1 could not do this — one migration named `public.neoq_jobs_id_seq`
  while its tables follow `search_path` — which is why `go.mod` carries a
  `replace` onto a fork (BUG-YJEIFH, upstream acaloiaro/neoq#149). Drop the
  `replace` when that lands, not before: `TestPostgresQueue_SchemaPinnedDSN`
  is what fails if it goes early. **Test any new postgres-touching dependency
  through a schema-pinned DSN**, not just the bare `RELA_TEST_DATABASE_URL` —
  the bare DSN resolves to `public`, which is precisely the one case that
  worked.

- **The configuration is not a secret; the data is.** `schema.yaml`,
  `data-entry.yaml`, `acl.yaml`, `schedules.yaml`, `scripts/`, `actions/`,
  `templates/` are operator-authored files that live in the repo — routinely a
  public one, as in any open-source app. Their *contents are already
  disclosed*. So list names, view/kanban/document/form/action names, entity and
  property names, `permission:` values, `script:` paths, even `command:`
  strings are **not** confidential, and code must not contort to conceal them:
  no filtering config endpoints per-principal, no
  indistinguishable-404-vs-403 on a *config key*, no narrowed wire types
  justified as leak prevention, no tests asserting a config name is
  unenumerable. The generalization of the `visible:` rule above (which already
  says property *names* need no concealment because the metamodel is served
  over the API) — it holds for every config surface, not just the metamodel.

  What IS secret is **entity and relation content, and entity existence**. The
  read-path gating in `docs/acl-security.md` and the row-level rule above are
  about *rows*, not about the schema describing them. Keep the uniform 404 for
  an **entity id**; a 403 naming the missing permission is the right answer for
  a **config-declared capability**, and is more useful to the operator
  debugging it.

  This is settled, not open: `docs/acl-security.md` § "Sidebar menu structure
  is principal-independent" already records the decision — the menu is served
  identically to every principal and only *counts* are gated, because "the
  metamodel is not a secret (it's served by `/api/v1/_schema`)" and a divergent
  menu per principal complicates SPA caching "for no confidentiality gain".
  Per-principal menu filtering is named there as a possible future tightening
  **deliberately not done**. Don't reintroduce it as a security measure.

  Two things this does NOT license. (1) *Secrets* are not config:
  `.rela/secrets.yaml`, DSNs, and tokens stay off the wire — that is why
  `RELA_DATABASE_URL` is env-only. (2) A gate may still exist for
  non-confidentiality reasons — to keep an unusable entry out of a sidebar, or
  to stop an unauthorized caller triggering an expensive render — just don't
  justify it as concealment, because the next person will build on a secrecy
  property that was never real. Write down which of the two you mean.
- **Mail: the render pipeline order is a security property, and delivery is
  best-effort.** `internal/mailrender` runs markdown → goldmark → **bluemonday
  on the untrusted CONTENT ONLY** → trusted template → **douceur inline LAST**.
  Both ends are load-bearing and verified: bluemonday strips `style` attributes
  (so sanitizing the assembled document ships unstyled mail, and also strips the
  `cellpadding`/`border`/`role` and `cid:` sources email needs), while douceur
  does **no** CSS value validation (so nothing may sanitize after it, and every
  value interpolated into CSS — palette tokens included — must be allowlisted).
  Reversing either is a silent downgrade, not a build failure.

  **`lua` may import `mailrender`, and that does NOT invert the `mail → lua`
  arrow.** `mail.render` (TKT-1GA2PG) builds a `mailrender.Message` from a
  script table so a Lua author gets the hardened template instead of
  hand-writing HTML for `mail.send`. The arch-lint rule forbidding
  `lua → mail` is untouched and still holds; `mailrender` is a *different*
  component and a true leaf (`go list -deps` shows zero internal imports), so
  the two arrows cannot form a cycle. The binding must never grow an `html:` or
  `css:` field — that would reintroduce the sanitizer bypass it exists to give
  authors an alternative to.

  **Email CSS is not web CSS, and the template's shape encodes that.** Section
  headings and the empty-section note are single-cell tables, and vertical gaps
  are spacer rows, because Outlook Windows honors `padding` only on table cells
  and `margin` is unsupported or partial across Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and AOL.
  A `<div>` with padding renders fine wherever you are likely to test it and
  collapses where you are not. `internal/mailrender/compat_test.go` scores the
  rendered output against a **vendored, pinned** Can I Email dataset
  (`testdata/caniemail.min.json`) and fails on a regression — treat it as a
  floor, not proof the mail looks right.

  **Dark mode is defensive, and `<meta name="color-scheme">` is deliberately
  absent.** Clients split three ways: some leave mail alone (Apple Mail, Gmail
  desktop, Yahoo, AOL), some partially invert and honor `prefers-color-scheme`
  (the Outlook family), and some fully invert and rewrite the query to
  `@media none` so they cannot be targeted at all (Gmail iOS/Android, Outlook
  Windows). The `@media` block serves the middle group; the palette (mid-tone
  borders, no pure white on pure black) serves the third. Adding the meta tag
  looks like a free win and is the trap: it opts Apple Mail *into* inverting,
  making a currently-correct rendering worse. A test asserts its absence.

  **A message's language belongs on `Message`, never on `Options`.** `Options`
  is renderer-scoped branding and a `Renderer` is built once per deployment, so
  an `Options.Lang` would stamp one language on every mail an instance sends —
  and a Dutch digest and an English one cannot both be right. `Options` carries
  only the *default*. The tag is validated in `mailrender` (shape-only BCP-47,
  rejected not escaped) because it arrives from both operator config and
  untrusted Lua, and validating at either call site would leave the other open.

  The SMTP password lives in **`.rela/secrets.yaml`** under `smtp_password` —
  the same store Lua scripts read, because an SMTP credential is no different
  in kind from the API tokens already kept there. `password_env` in
  `.rela/mail.yaml` names an environment variable as a fallback for
  container/systemd deployments; secrets.yaml wins when both are set. Never a
  literal `password:` in mail.yaml — that is refused at load.

  Header-injection validation is **rela's**, not the SMTP library's: go-mail
  rejects CR/LF in addresses but accepts it in a subject, where it is
  neutralized only incidentally by encoded-word escaping. `internal/mail`
  rejects CR/LF/NUL in every caller-supplied header value at enqueue.

  The outbox is an in-process buffer, **not a durable queue** — in `rela-server`
  there is no signal handler, so pending mail is lost on every restart with no
  drain. Mail is notification, never a system of record. A durable queue with
  swappable backends is IDEA-WIJ2H1.
- **Boundaries are enforced.** `just arch-lint` checks package import
  rules; run it before PR.

### Don't do this

- **Don't import `internal/graph` or `internal/model`** — both deleted.
  Use `internal/entity`, `internal/store`, `internal/tracer`.
- **Don't add a cross-subsystem service locator** (à la the removed
  `lua.Services`). Use `ReadDeps` / `WriteDeps` or a scoped consumer-side
  interface.
- **Don't call `ai.LoadProvider` directly from a new entry point.** Go
  through `script.NewWriterRuntime`, which calls `lua.LoadContextOptions`.
- **Don't wire AI into the validation path** — per-entity cost blowup
  with no quota. See `internal/ai/` docs for the rationale.
- **Don't reintroduce `internal/workspace`.** It was the legacy
  god-object aggregate; deleted in the workspace-decomposition arc.
  New code wires services individually via `appbuild.Discover` /
  `appbuild.New` or takes focused interfaces at the call site.
- **Don't run user-supplied Lua on the read path.** ACL gates evaluate
  against declarative policy + the graph; Lua participates only at write
  time. This targets unbounded/hot paths (per-row predicates on list reads),
  NOT a bounded single-subject evaluation the caller explicitly requested
  (e.g. performable transitions for one field on one entity). See
  `internal/entitymanager/CLAUDE.md`.

### Subsystem-specific rules (nested CLAUDE.md / godoc)

- **Writes, audit, ACL** → `internal/entitymanager/CLAUDE.md`. All writes
  go through `entitymanager.Manager`; do not write to `store.Store`
  directly from a write path.
- **Data-entry API + `_actions` affordances + write-validation policy** →
  `internal/dataentry/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Vue SPA build/test/architecture** → `frontend/CLAUDE.md`.
- **E2E tests** → `e2e/tests/AGENTS.md`.

## Architecture

rela is a schema-driven entity-graph platform. You define the shape of your
domain in a YAML metamodel (entity types, relation types, properties,
validation rules); rela gives you typed entities, typed relations, and tools
to query / validate / analyze / present the graph. Data is stored as markdown
files with YAML frontmatter.

Traceability (requirements → decisions → components) is one common use case,
not the identity. Other in-tree uses: ISO 27001 ISMS, project management,
DevOps runbooks, issue/ticket tracking (rela dogfoods itself — see `tickets/`),
documentation mirrors (`docs-project/`). Anything with typed entities and
relations fits.

```text
schema.yaml → Metamodel (entity types, relations, properties)
                     ↓
entities/*.md  → entity.Entity  ↘
                                 store.Store → tracer.Tracer  (pure reader)
relations/*.md → entity.Relation ↗          → search.Searcher (EntityObserver)
                                            → entitymanager.EntityManager
                                              (writes + automations + validation)
```

The store is the source of truth. `search` maintains a derived index as a
`store.EntityObserver`. `tracer` is a pure reader — no subscription, no
derived state. `entitymanager` is the "human intent" write path that runs
automations and validation on top of the store.

Write-path rules — validation policy (400/422/200-with-warnings), the
audit log, and ACL — live in the nested files
`internal/dataentry/CLAUDE.md` and `internal/entitymanager/CLAUDE.md`.

### Condition engine: `internal/predicate` + `internal/predicatefns`

`internal/predicate` is the shared **typed expression engine** — a sandboxed
Lua-expression subset with no I/O and fixed depth/step budgets. `Compile`
retains the boolean condition profile; `CompileValue` accepts an explicit
context profile for scalar computations. Programs expose exact static record
dependencies and conservative SQL-portability metadata. Context profiles may
enable or refuse language features, but an accepted IR node must keep identical
semantics across evaluators and future targets. `internal/predicatefns` is its metamodel-aware glue:
the `ScalarType`/`EntityRecordType` type adapter, the host-fn stdlib
(`match`/`regex`/`fuzzy`/`contains`/`len`/`today`), the `FromFilter`
transpiler, and the `Evaluator` (compile-once, metamodel-scoped Program
cache). New condition/`when:`-style code evaluates through `predicate`.

These surfaces are on predicate: ACL affordance `when:`
(`internal/affordances`), state-machine transition `When:`
(`internal/statemachine`), wizard-form condition lint
(`internal/conditionlint`), automation `on.when:`/`validate:`
(`internal/automation`), metamodel validation `When:`/`Then:`
(`internal/validation`), and the CLI `--filter` flag (`internal/cli/list.go`).

Automation `on.condition:` and validation `when_condition:`/`then_condition:`
take predicate **expressions** as written, ANDed with the filter-syntax
`when:`/`then:` keys beside them. They are separate keys because the two
syntaxes overlap without erroring: `filter.Parse` accepts
`days_between(entity.due, today()) <= 7` as a filter on a property named
`days_between(entity.due, today())`, which matches nothing, silently. Don't
add dialect sniffing — the key IS the declaration of intent. A `condition:`
that fails to compile is a **load error** (`NewEngineFromMetamodel` returns
one), as is an unparseable `when:` clause: dropping a constraint widens the
automation, so failing the load is the safe direction.

`internal/filter` is NOT frozen — it remains the **query-filtering** DSL
(the `--where` string syntax and metamodel legacy filter-strings). Legacy
`--where`/`When:`/`Then:` inputs are transpiled to predicate via
`predicatefns.FromFilter` on load (`--where` is deprecated in favor of
`--filter`). `filter.Match` still directly backs query-filtering in
`internal/dataentry` (SPA view/feed `where:`), `internal/lua` (script
queries), `internal/search/searchparser`, and `internal/cli/analyze.go` —
these were **not** migrated (they filter result sets, they don't gate
conditions). Don't describe filter as "removed" or "frozen"; it's the
query-filter DSL, predicate is the condition/policy engine.

### View export & transforms (`internal/transform`)

The `transforms:` map in the metamodel registers named `markdown → format`
external commands (see `docs/transforms.md`). A `transform.Renderer` produces
markdown; the engine runs it through a transform via `internal/cmdexec` (argv
array, no shell, temp-file `{in}`/`{out}`, timeout, output cap — the same
security-reviewed exec pattern `internal/attachment` uses). Rules for new code:

- **Export is downstream of an already-authorized view, never a new capability.**
  Entity/list export in `internal/dataentry` routes through the SAME ACL read
  path as the view (`visibleReader.getVisible` / `scopedSortedEntities`); a
  request may only choose a registered transform *name*, never a command/flag/path.
- **The list-table renderer lives in `internal/dataentry`, not `internal/transform`** —
  it needs the ACL neighbor-visibility gate (`visibleRelationIDs`) so hidden
  neighbor titles never leak into an export. `internal/transform` must NOT import
  `internal/dataentry`; the built-in single-entity renderer lives in `transform`,
  and `dataentry` supplies the list renderer as a `transform.Renderer`.
- **The per-type render override (`views.<type>.export_render`) renders through
  `documentService.RenderMarkdown`** — the same Lua document machinery, reached
  only AFTER the export has resolved the entity through the ACL read gate. Never
  call `script.ExecuteDocument` on a fresh unauthenticated surface, and keep the
  entity id path-validated (`isSafePathSegment`) before it reaches a render.
- **Export downloads are hardened** like attachment downloads (nosniff, sandbox
  CSP, `no-store`, sanitized `Content-Disposition`) — the produced bytes embed
  user content.
- **External commands are CONFINED in `internal/cmdexec`, and it fails closed.**
  Both export and attachment processing run third-party parsers over
  attacker-influenceable bytes, so the shared runner adds: a no-network,
  temp-dir-only sandbox (bubblewrap on Linux, `sandbox-exec` on macOS), rlimits
  (memory/PIDs/file size/CPU, Linux), process-group kill so a converter's helper
  cannot outlive the timeout, and a bounded pool capping concurrent runs. On a
  host with no mechanism, commands REFUSE to run — only command execution is
  blocked, never server startup. Do not add a "can I run?" predicate: call `Run`
  and handle its error; `Describe()` exists solely for the startup log.
- **The transform engine must be built ONCE and shared**, not per request — it
  owns the bounded pool, so a per-request engine gives every request its own pool
  and the concurrency cap bounds nothing.

### Storage backends & build tags

The storage + search backend is chosen at compile time by Go build tags.
The composition root has one `New` recipe per scenario over shared
`prepare()`/`assemble()` helpers — see `internal/appbuild/appbuild_{fs,memory,postgres,sqlite}.go`
and the matching `internal/cli/mcp_wiring_{fs,memory,postgres}.go`:

| Build tag        | Store      | Search                | Binaries                          |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| *(none, default)*| `fsstore`  | in-memory bleve       | `rela`, `rela-server`             |
| `memorybackend`  | `memstore` | `LinearSearch`        | (tests / experiments; no bleve)   |
| `postgres`       | `pgstore`  | PostgreSQL (`pg_trgm` + tsvector) | `rela-postgres`, `rela-server-postgres` |
| `sqlite`         | `sqlitestore` | in-memory/on-disk bleve       | `rela-sqlite`, `rela-server-sqlite` |

`sqlitestore` is the **single-process** backend (DEC-LFSYNY): one embedded
database file at `.rela/rela.db`, no server, and `Open` takes an exclusive
sidecar lock so a second process is refused rather than admitted. That refusal
is load-bearing — `unique:` is enforced by an untransacted scan in
entitymanager, so two writers would have no backstop and the violation would be
silent. It takes the strong `Tx` tier (rollback, post-commit-only events) but
has no versioning yet, so it currently has neither git history nor version
history. It also refuses to open on a filesystem where WAL cannot be enabled
(iCloud/Dropbox/SMB), because SQLite is unsafe there.

Rules when touching this:

- **The `postgres` build must not link bleve; the default build must not
  link pgx; no build but `sqlite` may link `modernc.org/sqlite`.** CI asserts
  each of these via `go list -deps` (the `postgres` job in `ci.yml`). Keep
  backend-specific imports inside the tagged recipe files.
- **`pgstore.New(db DBTX)` takes an injected pgx pool**, not a DSN. The
  postgres recipe builds one pool, runs `pgstore.Migrate`, and shares it
  between the store and the in-DB search backend. appbuild owns/closes the
  pool; `store.Close()` only tears down the watcher.
- **Build-agnostic wiring lives in `prepare`/`assemble`, never in a recipe.**
  A recipe may choose and order backend steps; if logic would be copy-pasted
  between recipes, it belongs in a shared helper. This is what keeps the three
  recipes from drifting (and where future per-backend audit/ACL variation goes).

  `prepare`'s result is the exported **`appbuild.SharedBase`** (TKT-P938T7):
  the tenant-independent half — validated config, options, parsed `acl.yaml`,
  loaded metamodel — with nothing derived from a store. Build one with
  `NewSharedBase` and call `base.Assemble(store, …)` once per store; `New`/
  `Discover` are that path with a single store. **The split is NOT along the
  `Services` field list**: `acl.Declarative` is built FROM the store (it needs a
  store-backed `acl.Graph`), so the ACL *policy* is shared while the *evaluator*
  is per-store — same for `lua.ReadDeps`. Two invariants keep reuse safe, both
  pinned by tests in `sharedbase_test.go`: assembly must never mutate `meta` or
  `aclPolicy` (they are pointers handed to every assembled `Services`, so a
  write leaks across tenants), and `Services.Close` must tear down only the
  store and search closer it was assembled with — never anything shared, or
  evicting one tenant breaks its siblings.
- **The metamodel is always read from disk**, even in the postgres build —
  `schema.yaml` and `templates/` stay on the filesystem, as does operator-authored
  config generally; PostgreSQL backs entities/relations/attachments/search. A
  postgres deployment still needs a `--project` dir.

  The exception is **runtime-written state** (TKT-VC27L3): on the postgres build
  `state.KV` is database-backed (`pgstore.StateKV`, wired via `stateKVFor`), so
  the document render cache, user settings, the operator logo/theme and the
  CalDAV alias table live in the `state_kv` table rather than under `.rela/`.
  That is deliberate — `docs/postgres-backend.md` documents several rela-server
  processes against one database, and node-local state means an uploaded logo is
  served by exactly one of them. Rows sit in the store's schema, so
  schema-per-tenant scopes this state for free. **Key validation is the `state`
  package's job** (`state.ValidatedKV` wraps the backend at the wiring site):
  pgstore must not import `internal/state` (arch-lint forbids a store depending
  on an application package), so it stores whatever key it is handed and the
  wrapper enforces the same rules `storage.RootedFS` gives FSKV. Any new backend
  must pass `internal/state/statetest.RunAll`.
- **Multi-writer change feed** (TKT-WZYWM9). The postgres watcher delivers
  cross-process writes via PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY`: each committed write does
  `pg_notify(rela_changed, '<origin>:<schema>:<kind>:<op>:<id>')` inside its
  transaction (so the 5 single-statement writes are wrapped in a tx); a listener
  goroutine (own connection, started in `Open`, stopped in `Close`) turns remote
  notifications into `store.Event`s on the in-process `Subscribe()` fan-out. Two
  payload fields do the routing, both filtered on receipt: a per-store random
  `originID` drops self-echoes (local writes are already emitted in-process), and
  the writing `schema` drops traffic from other schemas sharing the channel.
  NOTIFY is best-effort, so a `seq > watermark` catch-up (overlap window +
  idempotent re-snapshot; runs on connect/reconnect/safety-ticker, NOT per
  notification) recovers anything missed. **The channel is ONE constant
  (`rela_changed`), not one per schema** (TKT-9TOEBH): LISTEN is database-global
  *and* needs a dedicated session, so a per-schema name would cost one
  permanently-held connection per schema — the term that does not shrink under
  pooling. Isolation lives in the payload instead. What is **not** shared is the
  catch-up: `rela_seq` is per-schema and the catch-up query is unqualified SQL,
  so priming/catch-up stay bound to each store's own pool — do not "simplify"
  them onto a shared connection. If the listener can't connect, the store
  degrades with a warning (local events still work). Exact ordering (xid8 + `pg_snapshot_xmin`)
  is the documented upgrade, not built. The data-entry SSE feed consumes this
  via `App.startStoreEventBridge` (entity events only). fsstore/memstore stay
  in-process single-writer by nature.
- **Content versioning** (TKT-9INY0Y, postgres only). Two tables
  (`entity_versions` = one full snapshot per version; `schema_versions` =
  content-addressed render-schema projection, deduped) plus a dedicated
  `version_seq` sequence. **Use `version_seq`, never `rela_seq`** — `rela_seq`
  feeds the change-feed watermark (`primeWatermark`/`catchUp` scan
  entities/relations/deletions), and burning it on version rows that don't land
  in those tables would erode the overlap budget and drop real events. Capture
  is **hybrid**: rename+delete are captured synchronously at the entitymanager
  boundary (they carry old→new id / pre-delete state the sweep can't
  reconstruct); create/update are captured by a debounced reconciliation
  **sweep** goroutine (`sweep.go`, started/stopped like the listener). The sweep
  runs its **entire tick on ONE acquired pool connection** under
  `pg_try_advisory_lock` — the lock is session-scoped, so issuing the inserts via
  the pool (other sessions) would silently void the single-writer guarantee.
  Attribution comes from ctx only, via exactly two boundary-populated inputs —
  the store never learns the Principal by another route: sync captures carry it
  inside `store.VersionInput`, and create/update writes carry a
  `store.Attribution` on ctx (`store.WithAttribution`, set ONLY at the
  entitymanager boundary and ONLY for a real principal — never translate a
  zero/unknown principal, RR-U964M0) which pgstore stamps into
  `entities/relations.last_edited_by_user/_tool` (TKT-ZIRMGM). The sweep copies
  those columns onto swept versions; NULL columns (legacy rows, unattributed
  writes) fall back to the `version-sweep` system principal — never a guessed
  or literal-"unknown" identity. Author-boundary segmentation (flush-on-author-
  change) is TKT-0IGI4V, not built: two authors in one debounce window merge
  into one version attributed to the last of them. Lineage across a
  rename/id-reuse is fenced by `[lo,hi)` vseq ranges in a recursive-CTE walk (an
  unbounded `entity_id = ANY(...)` read would merge two entities' histories — see
  the version.go doc). `HistoryReader`/`VersionWriter` are optional store
  capabilities (type-asserted like `store.Formatter`), NOT part of `store.Store`.
- **Relation versioning** (TKT-92JL8P, postgres only) extends the above to
  relations, which carry their own props + body. A `relation_versions` table
  reuses `version_seq` + `schema_versions`; identity is a surrogate
  `rel_record_id` **column ON the `relations` row** (`DEFAULT nextval(...)`,
  carried through writes) — NOT reconstructed per sweep-tick, which would race the
  sync path and merge/fork lineages. Delete+recreate of the same `(from,type,to)`
  mints a fresh id (histories don't merge). Capture: create/update via the sweep's
  second `FROM relations` scan (entities-then-relations, same tick/lock);
  **delete synchronously via `DeleteResult.DeletedRelations`** — the single path
  for BOTH explicit `DeleteRelation` and entity **cascade** delete (the store
  bulk-deletes relations below the entitymanager, so cascade edges would otherwise
  lose history). Rename **stitches** (not forks): the entitymanager captures a
  `rename` version per incident relation on the new triple carrying
  `prev_from`/`prev_to`, and `relationLineageIDs` walks those links so history is
  continuous. Since #1127 the store renames **atomically** (bulk in-place
  `UPDATE relations SET from_id=...`), so a relation KEEPS its `rel_record_id`
  across the rename — the lineage is already continuous on one id and the
  `rename` version merely appends a marker (the `prev_from`/`prev_to` stitch walk
  finds no fork; it stays as belt-and-braces for any future non-atomic path).
  Rename capture is **sync-only best-effort**: the atomic re-key does NOT bump
  `relations.updated_at` (TKT-9TQ6I), so the sweep cannot back-fill a rename the
  synchronous hook misses — acceptable because a miss loses only the rename
  marker, never lineage continuity. Read/restore is gated on **both** endpoints
  (FROM ∧ TO) — the FROM
  entity only *owns* the UI placement, it is not the auth boundary (a TO-side
  oracle otherwise). Relations have NO field-level redaction today; relation
  history exposes exactly what a live relation GET does. `RelationHistoryReader`/
  `RelationVersionWriter` are SEPARATE optional capabilities, type-asserted
  independently of the entity ones.
- **Version purge** (TKT-BW6UUL, postgres only) is the audited, irreversible
  exception to append-only history — hard-deletes version rows for compliance
  redaction. `VersionPurger`/`RelationVersionPurger` are SEPARATE optional
  capabilities (`purge.go`), one `PurgeVersions`/`PurgeRelationVersions` method
  each. Load-bearing guardrails (design-review, do not relax): the whole op runs
  under **`sweepAdvisoryLockKey`** (mutually exclusive with a sweep tick — a purge
  racing a capture-insert loses the erasure); it **REFUSES while a live row still
  holds the content** unless `--force-live` (else the sweep re-captures it within
  one interval — a `VersionOpPurge` no-content tombstone whose content_hash = the
  live hash suppresses that re-capture via the sweep's existing dedup); it
  **REFUSES a rename row** (purging one orphans/forks the lineage walk — v1 is
  non-rename-only); `--all` purges the **fenced lineage** (`lineageCTE` /
  `relationLineageIDs`), never `WHERE id=$1` (id-reuse would destroy unrelated
  history). CLI-only (`history-purge`/`relation-history-purge`), dry-run by
  default; trust boundary is operator shell (no ACL check — like `db migrate`),
  audited via the `audit.Audit` sink (`OpPurgeVersion`, `svc.Audit()`), never
  echoing purged content. `schema_versions` is projection-only + FK-shared, so
  purge never deletes it. Purge is necessary-not-sufficient for erasure (live
  row / PITR backups survive) — see the postgres-backend guide.
- **Data migration** (TKT-0C57FS, `internal/datamigration`,
  `docs/data-migration.md`). When schema.yaml's DATA SHAPE changes, the gate
  (evaluated per process start in `appbuild.assemble`) compares the store's
  `state.KV` marker against `metamodel.ShapeProjection().Hash()` and adopts
  compatible changes; incompatible ones need operator-authored `migrations/`
  files (`rela migrate gen|data`). **Two schema hashes coexist on purpose**:
  `RenderProjection` (version rendering, `schema_versions` dedup — stability
  load-bearing, do not extend) vs `ShapeProjection` (migration identity —
  includes relations + defaults, excludes id prefixes). Migration/GC writes
  are the third sanctioned raw-store exception (after `db migrate` and
  `history-purge`): operator-shell trust, no ACL, explicit audit records
  (`data-migration`/`data-gc`), `store.WithAttribution`, and synchronous
  pre-delete version capture on pg (the sweep cannot reconstruct deleted
  rows). Migration steps must stay idempotent — re-run IS the crash
  recovery. The Lua step is a pure transform (patch in, patch out, engine
  applies); never hand it a write handle.
- DSN is read from the `RELA_DATABASE_URL` env var **only** — there is no
  `--database-url` flag, so the credential never lands in `ps`/shell history.
  `appbuild.Discover` reads the env into `appbuild.Config.DatabaseURL`; the
  `db` commands read the env directly. Don't add a DSN flag.
- **Derived static-query indexes are all-or-nothing desired state.** The
  PostgreSQL reconciler owns only `rela_derived_query__*` and derives those
  indexes from validated static dashboard/next-action query shapes. Never
  reconcile a partial set after a `data-entry.yaml` read/parse/validation
  failure: an absent desired object means DROP, so partial input is destructive.
  Runtime/ad-hoc queries never issue DDL. Pushdown and index inference must use
  the same `internal/queryplan` eligibility decision, and an EXPLAIN test must
  prove each newly supported SQL shape actually uses its generated index.
- **Migrations** are embedded SQL (`pgstore/migrations/*.sql`), applied by
  `pgstore.Migrate` in one transaction under a `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
  (concurrent-start safe; forward-only). Auto-applied on first store open;
  also runnable explicitly via the postgres-build `rela db migrate` / `rela db
  status` commands (`pgstore.Status` is the read-only version check). `rela db`
  errors clearly in non-postgres builds.
- A new `store.Store` implementation must pass `internal/store/storetest`
  (`RunAll` + the fuzz functions). pgstore's suite is DB-gated on
  `RELA_TEST_DATABASE_URL` (skips when unset). Run it with `just test-postgres`.

## Tests

- Prefer table-driven tests with `t.Run(tc.name, ...)` subtests.
- Use `t.Helper()` on assertion helpers.
- `internal/store/storetest` provides the store conformance harness — any
  new `store.Store` implementation must pass it. Likewise any new
  `search.VisibleSearcher` implementation must pass
  `storetest.RunVisibleSearchTests` (the ACL-scoped search contract).
- Race detector is on in CI; don't add `//go:build !race` tags.

## Coverage

Go: `go-test-coverage` enforces **package floor thresholds** (no ratchet);
minimums live in `.testcoverage.yml`. Coverage within the floor is free to
move up or down — floors exist to catch "new untested package added" and
"core package silently lost its tests." The frontend has no coverage
enforcement — unit tests run plain (`npm run test:run`).

- Run locally: `just coverage-check`, `just coverage-html`.
- When a floor fails, add tests — don't lower the threshold without a reason.
- Use `// coverage-ignore: <reason>` sparingly, only for genuinely
  untestable code (main functions, external-tool dependencies,
  OS-specific paths). Reason is required.

## Lint

golangci-lint with project rules. Test files exempt from `dupl`, `funlen`,
magic numbers. Cobra `cmd`/`args` unused parameters allowed. Line length: 120.

**God-object load lines** (`just plimsoll`, CI job "God-object lint"). The
[plimsoll](https://github.com/sourcehaven-bv/plimsoll) linter caps three
independent surfaces — the metric that tracks a type accreting into a
god-object (`App`, `Runtime`, `FSStore` got there because nothing stopped them):

- **`max-methods` (40)** — total methods, exported + unexported. The backstop
  for internal sprawl: a receiver with dozens of private helpers is one struct
  whose fields they can all reach.
- **`max-exported-methods` (20)** — exported methods only. The sharper signal,
  since the public API is the coupling surface consumers bind to. Note these
  often diverge wildly from the total: `App` is 226 methods but only 13
  exported; the genuinely-wide *public* APIs are the store implementations and
  schema value types (`FSStore`, `MemStore`, `Metamodel`).
- **`max-fields` (20)** — exported struct fields.

A new type over any line fails CI. Existing offenders are grandfathered with a
`//plimsoll:max-methods=N` / `max-exported-methods=N` / `max-fields=N` directive
at the declaration site, pinned to the current count so they can't grow; ratchet
those down as you decompose (TKT-N0IKN9). A store-implementation's exported count
is the mandated `store.Store` interface, so its directive is a documented
"required interface" exception rather than a ratchet target. Prefer splitting the
type over raising the number.

**Comment discipline** (`just comment-lint`, CI job "Comment lint").
[commentlint](https://github.com/sourcehaven-bv/commentlint) checks comments
against the scope they are attached to. `commented-code` and `doclink` are
**blocking gates** (both clean); the rest are advisory (`just comment-report`)
with a backlog being worked down:

- **`duplication`** — the same fact explained in two or more comments. The
  signal we act on: a fact stored three times gets corrected in one place and
  goes stale in two. Remedy is to hoist it to the type or package they cite.
- **`nil-contract`** — nil behaviour as ad-hoc prose. Go cannot express this
  in a type, so the convention is `Nil: rejected|accepted|never returned —
  <why>`. Fixing one removes it permanently (the rule skips tagged comments).
- **`doclink`** (gate) — a `[Bracketed.Reference]` that resolves to nothing.
  Go degrades these silently (pkg.go.dev renders the literal brackets) and no
  other linter catches them — `go vet`, `staticcheck` and `godoclint` all
  report zero on a broken link. Most are a bare `[Method]` where Go needs
  `[Recv.Method]`; the finding names the qualified form. Note Go cannot link
  an unexported member or a symbol from an unimported package at all — those
  references should simply lose their brackets.
- **`param-contract`** — a precondition asserted about a bare `string`/`int`
  parameter ("MUST already have passed containedPath"). Usually a missing
  type; this repo already does it where it matters most, e.g.
  `principal.Principal` keeps `roles` unexported so they can only enter
  through a verifying constructor.
- `too-long` and `scope-reach` are **off** — see `.commentlint.yml` for why.

False positives are expected (every rule is a heuristic over prose). Suppress
with `//commentlint:ignore <rule>  <reason>` on the declaration line, or via
`.commentlint.yml` when the same prose recurs across many sites.

**Read the finding before suppressing it.** A blocking check with an easy
escape hatch makes silencing the cheapest path to green, and a reviewer
skimming a diff cannot tell a considered suppression from a reflex one. Fixing
the comment is the outcome the gate exists for; suppression is for findings
that are genuinely *wrong*, and the reason must say why. "Suppressed to unblock
CI" is not a reason. The failure message says all this too, at the moment it
matters.

## Security

`govulncheck` runs on every PR touching `go.mod` / `go.sum` (the `vulncheck`
job in `ci.yml`) and weekly from `security.yml`. Known-unfixable vulns are
filtered via `scripts/govulncheck-filtered.sh` — keep `IGNORED_OSVS` in sync
with `scripts/govulncheck-fixable.sh`. Run locally: `just govulncheck`.

## Commands

Read the `justfile` for the full set. The non-obvious ones: `just arch-lint`
(package boundary check), `just ci` (full pipeline), `just dev` (data-entry
server locally), `just coverage-check`. `go test -run TestName ./...` for a
single test.

## Rela for Planning & Issue Tracking

This project uses two rela instances via MCP for design and issue tracking:

- **rela-docs**: Documentation entities (concepts, features, guides, tutorials, scenarios)
- **rela-issues-and-design-tickets**: Issue tracking (tickets, features, decisions, concepts, risks, measures, tests)

### Workflow for Creating Tickets/Entities

When creating or updating entities in `rela-issues-and-design-tickets`:

1. **Create the entity** with required properties
2. **Run ALL analyze tools** to check for issues:
   - `analyze_cardinality` - check required relations
   - `analyze_orphans` - find unlinked entities
   - `analyze_properties` - validate property values
   - `analyze_validations` - run custom validation rules
3. **Fix any violations** (create missing relations, add required properties, etc.)
4. **Repeat analysis until ALL checks pass** - do not stop after fixing one issue

### Common Required Relations

| Entity Type | Required Relations |
|-------------|-------------------|
| ticket | `affects` → concept (min 1), `implements` → feature (min 1) |
| feature | `requires` → concept (min 1) |
| test-case/test-suite | `test-covers` → concept (min 1), `verifies` → feature/ticket (min 1) |
| doc-task | `affects` → concept (min 1), `triggered-by` → ticket/feature/decision (min 1), `updates` → guide/tutorial/scenario (min 1) |
| research | `researches` → concept (min 1) |

### Research Documents

For larger features, run `/research <topic>` before planning to survey
approaches and document tradeoffs. This creates a `research` entity (RES-xxxx)
with structured sections: Problem, Context, Options, Recommendation.

**Workflow:**

1. `/research` creates the entity in `in-progress` and links it to concepts
2. The agent surveys the codebase and external approaches
3. Options are documented with pros/cons/effort
4. A recommendation is made and presented for user review
5. The research is linked to the ticket/feature via `has-research`

**When to use:** Enhancements or features where the approach isn't obvious,
multiple viable options exist, or the change touches unfamiliar subsystems.
The planning checklist has a research item that can be skipped with N/A for
smaller work.

### Validation Rules

The metamodel includes validation rules that enforce:

- In-progress bugs should have `why1` and `why2` started
- Done bugs must have 5-whys analysis (`why1`-`why3` required) and `prevention`
- Ready tickets need `effort`, `priority`, and `description`
- Accepted decisions need `date`, `context`, and `consequences`

Always run `analyze_validations` to catch these issues.

### 5-Whys for Bug Analysis

Bug tickets use the 5-whys method for root cause analysis:

| Property | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `why1` | What was the immediate cause? |
| `why2` | Why did that happen? |
| `why3` | Why did that happen? |
| `why4` | Why did that happen? |
| `why5` | What is the systemic root cause? |

Done bugs require at least 3 levels (why1-why3). The goal is to reach systemic causes
that can be addressed with process/tooling improvements documented in `prevention`.

### Workflow Checklists

Tickets and bugs use workflow checklists to ensure thorough planning, execution, and review.
Each phase has a dedicated checklist entity with standard items from templates.

**Ticket Workflow:**

| `docs-checklist` | Code docs, project docs, external docs | Enhancement/docs tickets entering `done` |

**Review Commands:**

| Command | When to Use | Creates |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/design-review` | After planning, before implementation | `review-response` entities for design issues |
| `/code-review` | During review phase, after implementation | `review-response` entities for code issues |

**Agent Workflow for Tickets:**

Checklists are **automatically created** when tickets/bugs transition to specific statuses.
The `create_entity` automation with `if_exists: skip` ensures no duplicates.

1. **Start Planning** (status: `planning`)
   - Planning checklist is auto-created and linked via `has-planning`
   - Work through checklist items: understanding, approach, security, test plan
   - Run `/design-review` to catch issues before implementation
   - Address all critical/significant design findings
   - Mark checklist `status=done` when complete

2. **Start Implementation** (status: `in-progress`)
   - Implementation checklist is auto-created and linked via `has-implementation`
   - Work through development and quality items

3. **Start Review** (status: `review`)
   - Review checklist is auto-created and linked via `has-review`
   - Run `/code-review` to perform thorough code review
   - Address all critical/significant code review findings
   - If enhancement or docs ticket, manually create `docs-checklist`
   - Complete all checks before marking done

4. **Complete** (status: `done`)
   - All linked checklists must have `status=done`
   - All checklist items must be checked or skipped with reason

5. **Create PR** (after `done`)
   - Run `/pr` to create PR and monitor CI until all checks pass
   - Fixes any CI failures (lint, test, coverage) automatically
   - The PR URL and CI status are NOT recorded in the review-checklist.
     They post-date it — `/pr` gates on the ticket already being `done` and
     validating clean, and a `done` checklist may have no unchecked items, so
     an item asking for the PR URL could only be satisfied by a PR that does
     not exist yet (TKT-UFV01M). GitHub records both; the branch and commit
     messages carry the ticket ID.

**Bug Workflow Automations:**

- `analyzing` → auto-creates `bug-analysis-checklist` via `has-bug-analysis`
- `in-progress` → auto-creates `implementation-checklist` via `has-implementation`
- `review` → auto-creates `review-checklist` via `has-review`

**Skipping Checklist Items:**

When an item doesn't apply, use strikethrough with a reason in parentheses:

```markdown
- [x] ~~API docs updated~~ (N/A: no API changes)
- [x] ~~Performance check~~ (N/A: documentation-only change)
```

Items without reasons will fail validation.

### Review Response Protocol

**Triggering Code Review:**

When a ticket/bug enters `review` status, run the `/code-review` command. This invokes the
cranky-code-reviewer agent to perform a thorough code review and automatically creates
`review-response` entities for each finding.

Alternatively, invoke the cranky-code-reviewer agent directly for ad-hoc reviews.

**Creating Review Responses:**

For each finding from code review:

1. Create a `review-response` entity with:
   - `title`: Brief description of the finding
   - `finding`: Full description of the issue
   - `severity`: `critical` | `significant` | `minor` | `nit`
   - `status`: `open`
2. Link to ticket/bug via `has-review-response` relation

**Addressing Review Responses:**

| Severity | Required Action |
|----------|-----------------|
| critical | MUST be fixed before done |
| significant | MUST be fixed before done |
| minor | Should fix, can defer with reason |
| nit | Optional, can wont-fix with reason |

When addressing a finding:

- Fix the issue in code
- Update status to `addressed`
- Document the `resolution` (how it was fixed)

When not addressing:

- Set status to `wont-fix` or `deferred`
- Document the `reason` (justification required)

**Validation Gates:**

Tickets/bugs cannot be marked `done` if they have:

- Open critical review responses
- Open significant review responses

Minor/nit findings may remain open with warnings.

### Automation Actions

Status transitions auto-create checklists (and similar side effects) via
automations declared in the project's `schema.yaml`. Action types
(`set`, `create_relation`, `create_entity` with `if_exists`) and
interpolation patterns (`{{new.property}}`, `{{entity.id}}`, `{{today}}`)
are documented in `docs/metamodel.md` and exemplified in the live
`schema.yaml`. Read those rather than relying on a copy here — a stale
copy is worse than a pointer.

Common mistake: `{{entity.title}}` is wrong; use `{{new.title}}` for a
property of the triggering entity.
