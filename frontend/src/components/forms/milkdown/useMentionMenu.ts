/**
 * The `@` completion menu, as the SPA form consumes it.
 *
 * What the menu shows for each query is decided by `planMention`
 * (`mentionPlan.ts`, TKT-39TIB4): a starting list for a bare `@`, types for one
 * or two letters, then search results with types beside them. A type scope is
 * document text (`@ticket:`), so this controller keeps no scope of its own; it
 * re-plans from the query on every keystroke.
 *
 * The search/staleness state machine lives in `mentionMenuState.ts` because the
 * sandboxed app editor runs the same machine without Vue, and a second copy of
 * that logic is exactly the drift TKT-D2JML7 removed. What stays here is the
 * reactivity, the transports, the stages and the type rows, which are SPA-only:
 * the sandboxed app runs under `connect-src 'none'` and has no route to the
 * schema's type list. Nothing here touches ProseMirror.
 *
 * # The query reaches the server unmodified
 *
 * Nothing here rewrites, splits or sanitizes the search text. Sending
 * word-split forms was measured to destroy ID ranking on the bleve backend (the
 * regression BUG-O09QUC exists to prevent) and to return nothing at all on the
 * linear and postgres backends, which match the query as one substring. The
 * only thing removed is a `ticket:` scope, which travels as the `type`
 * parameter instead.
