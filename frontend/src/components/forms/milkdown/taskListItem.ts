/**
 * GFM task lists: a real checkbox in the editor, and a command to make one.
 *
 * Milkdown's GFM preset parses and serializes `- [ ] item` correctly and adds a
 * three-valued `checked` attribute to `list_item` (`null` = not a task, `false`
 * = open, `true` = done). What it does NOT do is draw anything: its `toDOM`
 * emits `<li data-item-type="task" data-checked="false">` and leaves the
 * affordance to the host app.
 *
 * That is why task lists rendered as bare bullets (BUG-KHQXHH). The editing
 * surface wears `md-body` and inherits `styles/markdown-content.css`, whose
 * task-list rules all key on `input[type='checkbox']` — an element that was
 * never there, so every selector missed.
 *
 * The fix is a node view that injects a real `<input type="checkbox">` as the
 * item's first child, which is the shape both `marked` (client) and goldmark
 * (server) already produce. Matching their DOM rather than styling Milkdown's
 * data attributes is deliberate: it keeps ONE stylesheet governing all three
 * surfaces, so the editor cannot drift from the rendered view. The preset also
 * ships no task-list command, only an input rule, so `toggleTaskListCommand`
 * supplies the toolbar's inverse.
