/**
 * The `entityRef` ProseMirror node: an entity reference rendered as a link.
 *
 * rela writes an entity reference into markdown as an inline code span holding
 * the entity ID, `` `TKT-XXXX` ``. That storage format does not change here.
 * What changes is how the editor shows it: instead of monospaced raw ID, the
 * user sees the entity's title as a link, matching what the rendered view
 * already produces via `rewriteEntityRefToken` in `utils/markdown.ts`.
 *
 * The node is atomic. A reference is one indivisible thing: putting a cursor
 * inside `TKT-XXXX` and deleting a character would produce a reference to an
 * entity that does not exist, and the user has no reason to want that.
 *
 * ## Why a node rather than a mark
 *
 * The built-in `inlineCode` is a mark, and Milkdown's parser resolves a
 * markdown node against `{...schema.nodes, ...schema.marks}` taking the first
 * match. Object spread puts every node ahead of every mark, so an `entityRef`
 * node sees each `inlineCode` mdast node before the `inlineCode` mark does and
 * can claim the ones that look like entity references. `NodeSchema.priority`
 * does NOT do this — it only feeds `parseDOM` rule ordering — so the node/mark
 * distinction is what the behaviour rests on.

 * insertion paths would disagree about what is representable.
