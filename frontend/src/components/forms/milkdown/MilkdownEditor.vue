/**
 * The WYSIWYG markdown editor.
 *
 * Public contract is unchanged from the editor it replaces: `modelValue` in,
 * `update:modelValue` out. `DynamicForm` needs no changes.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. Serialization is pinned by `RELA_STRINGIFY_OPTIONS` and checked against
 *    every entity body in the repository by the corpus test. `guardWriteBack`
 *    then suppresses the reformatting that survives, so opening an entity and
 *    saving it without edits emits nothing.
 * 2. Entity references are `entityRef` nodes that serialize back to the exact
 *    code span they came from. Titles are view-only attributes and never reach
 *    the markdown.
 * 3. Titles come only from the injected `refResolver`, which is fed by the
 *    server's per-principal `mentions` map. The editor never derives a title
 *    from the graph itself.
