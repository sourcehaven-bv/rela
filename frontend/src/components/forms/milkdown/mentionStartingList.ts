 * The `@` menu's starting list: what it offers before the user types a query.

 * Three sources, in order (TKT-39TIB4, spec §2):
 *
 * 1. Entities related to the entity being edited. Writing about a ticket, you
 *    most often mention its feature, its concepts or a sibling.
 * 2. Entities this browser recently opened or mentioned (`recentEntities`).
 * 3. Globally recently modified entities, to fill what is left.
 *
 * The list is deduplicated, capped, and never contains the entity being edited.
 * A scoped query (`@ticket:`) keeps only that type.
 *
 * Every row comes from the ACL-gated API. The browser-local list holds ids
 * only; each is loaded again before it is shown, so a row the user can no
 * longer read is dropped rather than shown from a local copy.
 *
 * Transport-free: the caller injects the three fetches, which keeps this
 * testable and keeps axios out of it.
