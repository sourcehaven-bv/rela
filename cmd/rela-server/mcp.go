// It returns an error rather than exiting so the caller owns the exit, the
// same shape as validateIdentityFlags. A failure here MUST stop startup: the
// operator asked for MCP, and booting without it would serve a server that
// silently lacks the feature they enabled.
//
// **Identity comes from the request, not from here.** Unlike `rela mcp`
// (stdio), which stamps one process-wide system principal, the remote server
// serves many callers. The MCP server's principal middleware preserves an
// identity already on the ctx, and the transport hands it the *http.Request
// ctx that `requireVerifiedJWT` has stamped — so `WithPrincipal` below is
// only the fallback for a request that somehow carries none. It is a real,
// non-zero system principal (NewServer requires one) rather than a
// placeholder, so an unattributed write is recorded as the server itself
// rather than as a guessed user.
//
// **Reads are ACL-gated.** Every read handle comes from
// [appbuild.Services.GatedReads] via [remoteMCPDeps], which resolves the ctx
// principal per call.
// This is the opposite of the stdio wiring's deliberate NopACL: there the
// filesystem is the trust boundary (anyone who can run `rela mcp` can edit
// the files directly), so a gate would defend nothing. A remote caller has no
// filesystem access, so the ACL is the ONLY boundary.
//
// **No Lua tools.** The server is built without [relamcp.WithLuaTools], so
// lua_eval and lua_run do not exist here. A remote caller may not
// run scripts in the server process.
