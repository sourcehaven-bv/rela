# Pre-Completion Review

Perform self-review before marking a ticket/bug as done.

The review-checklist was created automatically when status changed to `review`.

## Automated Checks

Run and verify:

```bash
just test        # All tests pass?
just lint        # Lint clean?
just coverage-check  # Coverage maintained?
```

Mark each as done in the review checklist.

## Code Review

Run `/code-review` to invoke the cranky-code-reviewer agent. This will:

- Perform thorough code review of changes
- Create `review-response` entities for each finding
- Link findings to the current ticket

**Required**: All critical and significant findings must be addressed before completion.

## Manual Review

- [ ] Self-review the diff (`git diff`)
- [ ] Commit messages explain the why, not just the what
- [ ] No unrelated changes included
- [ ] No debug code, console.logs, or TODOs left behind

## Final Verification

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from planning checklist are met
- [ ] Works as expected when tested locally

## Documentation (REQUIRED for enhancements)

**For enhancement tickets (kind=enhancement), you MUST:**

1. Create `docs-checklist` entity from template
2. Link to ticket via `has-docs` relation
3. Update user-facing documentation per planning checklist
4. Mark docs-checklist as `done`

Check the planning checklist's "Documentation Impact" section for which docs need updating.

Skip this section only for bugs and internal refactors.

## Completion

Once all checks pass:

1. Mark review checklist as `done`
2. Mark docs checklist as `done` (if applicable)
3. Transition ticket/bug to `done`
4. Run `analyze_validations` to verify completion

Output a summary of what was completed and any notes for the user.
