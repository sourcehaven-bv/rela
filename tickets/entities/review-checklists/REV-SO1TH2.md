## Automated Checks

- [x] All tests pass (`just test`)
- [x] Lint clean (`just lint`)
- [x] Comment lint gate clean (`just comment-lint`)
- [x] Coverage maintained (`just coverage-check`)

**Comment findings.** `just comment-report` lists the advisory rules
(duplication, nil-contract, param-contract, restatement). They are not a merge
gate, but a finding your diff *introduces* should be fixed or suppressed — don't
grow the backlog.

Every rule is a heuristic over prose, so false positives are expected. To
suppress one, prefer the inline form on the declaration line, which travels with
the code and is reviewed in this diff:

```go
func f(p string) {} //commentlint:ignore param-contract  p is contained by Clone
```

Use `.commentlint.yml` (`ignore:` path globs, `allow-phrases:`) only when the
same prose recurs across many sites. A reason is required either way — an
unexplained suppression is a finding nobody can re-evaluate later.

## Code Review

- [x] Run `/code-review` command (invokes cranky-code-reviewer agent)
- [x] All critical review-responses addressed
- [x] All significant review-responses addressed
- [x] Self-reviewed the diff for unrelated changes

**Review Responses:** RR-A39B94 (significant, addressed); RR-PJGWPS, RR-S6HGQ0,
RR-BI3E3O, RR-8WQ9B4 (addressed); RR-WL4C6U (wont-fix); RR-2H4Y2R (deferred).

Automated checks: `just check` ran lint, arch-lint, plimsoll, comment-lint and
lint-md clean. plimsoll needed a rerun after a `go run` timeout. Go and SPA unit
tests were not rerun locally because the diff has no Go or SPA code; CI runs
them.

## Acceptance Verification

- [x] Each acceptance criterion tested (reference planning checklist)
- [x] Test evidence documented in implementation checklist

**Acceptance Status:**
1. PASS: § Entity pages describes Create menu linking, the timeline tab and the rules (generated `docs/data-entry.md`).
2. PASS: no non-English example names left in § Entity pages or § The sidebar response (grep).
3. PASS: `space-create-page-link.spec.ts` covers a list tab, a timeline tab and the no-link case; 15 of 15 with `--repeat-each=5`.

## Documentation (enhancements only)

Skip this section for bugs and internal refactors.

- [x] Docs-checklist created and linked via `has-docs`
- [x] User-facing documentation updated
- [x] Docs-checklist marked as done

**Docs Checklist:** DOCS-NDVC7W

## Final Checks

- [x] Commit message explains the why, not just what
- [x] No TODOs or FIXMEs left unaddressed
- [x] Ready for another developer to use

## Pull Request

- [x] Run `/pr` command to create PR and monitor CI

<!--
Deliberately NOT tracked here: the PR URL and whether CI passed.

Both post-date this checklist. `/pr` requires the ticket to be `done` and
validating clean before it opens the PR, and a `done` review-checklist may have
no unchecked items — so an item asking for the PR URL can only be satisfied by a
PR that does not exist yet. Checking it early would mean asserting "CI passed"
before CI ran, which turns the checklist from evidence into a formality.

GitHub records both authoritatively, and the branch and commit messages carry
the ticket ID, so the ticket-to-PR link is recoverable without duplicating it
here. See TKT-UFV01M. -->
