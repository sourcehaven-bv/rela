## Automated Checks

- [x] All tests pass (`just test`)
- [x] Lint clean (`just lint`)
- [x] Comment lint gate clean (`just comment-lint`)
- [x] Coverage maintained (`just coverage-check`)

**Comment findings.** `just comment-report` lists the advisory rules
(duplication, nil-contract, param-contract, restatement). They are not a merge
gate, but a finding your diff *introduces* should be fixed or suppressed — don't
grow the backlog.

Every rule is a heuristic over prose, so false positives are expected. To
suppress one, prefer the inline form on the declaration line, which travels with
the code and is reviewed in this diff:

```go
func f(p string) {} //commentlint:ignore param-contract  p is contained by Clone
```

Use `.commentlint.yml` (`ignore:` path globs, `allow-phrases:`) only when the
same prose recurs across many sites. A reason is required either way — an
unexplained suppression is a finding nobody can re-evaluate later.

## Code Review

- [x] Code review completed against the full stacked diff
- [x] All critical review-responses addressed
- [x] All significant review-responses addressed
- [x] Self-reviewed the diff for unrelated changes

**Review Responses:** RR-MAILI1, RR-MAILI2, and RR-MAILI3. The implementation
retains their calendar-occurrence, no-extra-claim-store, and authority-reload
resolutions. No new critical/significant scheduler finding remained.

## Acceptance Verification

- [x] Each acceptance criterion tested (reference planning checklist)
- [x] Test evidence documented in implementation checklist

**Acceptance Status:**
AC1/7/9/10 PASS in expansion payload/idempotency/bound tests; AC2/8/11 PASS in
recipient child identity and safe-skip tests; AC3 PASS through appbuild's
visible-reader boundary; AC4/5 PASS in config regression tables; AC6 PASS by
independent bounded-retry child shape.

## Documentation (enhancements only)

Skip this section for bugs and internal refactors.

- [x] Docs-checklist created and linked via `has-docs`
- [x] User-facing documentation updated
- [x] Docs-checklist marked as done

**Docs Checklist:** DOCS-FEACH1

## Final Checks

- [x] Commit message explains the why, not just what
- [x] No TODOs or FIXMEs left unaddressed
- [x] Ready for another developer to use

## Pull Request

- [x] ~~Run `/pr` command to create PR and monitor CI~~ (deferred: user asked
  to stop once the stacked branch is ready for PR creation)

<!--
Deliberately NOT tracked here: the PR URL and whether CI passed.

Both post-date this checklist. `/pr` requires the ticket to be `done` and
validating clean before it opens the PR, and a `done` review-checklist may have
no unchecked items — so an item asking for the PR URL can only be satisfied by a
PR that does not exist yet. Checking it early would mean asserting "CI passed"
before CI ran, which turns the checklist from evidence into a formality.

GitHub records both authoritatively, and the branch and commit messages carry
the ticket ID, so the ticket-to-PR link is recoverable without duplicating it
here. See TKT-UFV01M. -->
