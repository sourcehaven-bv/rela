## Automated Checks

- [x] All tests pass (`just test`)
- [x] Lint clean (`just lint`)
- [x] Comment lint gate clean (`just comment-lint`)
- [x] Coverage maintained (`just coverage-check`)

**Comment findings.** `just comment-report` lists the advisory rules
(duplication, nil-contract, param-contract, restatement). They are not a merge
gate, but a finding your diff *introduces* should be fixed or suppressed — don't
grow the backlog.

Every rule is a heuristic over prose, so false positives are expected. To
suppress one, prefer the inline form on the declaration line, which travels with
the code and is reviewed in this diff:

```go
func f(p string) {} //commentlint:ignore param-contract  p is contained by Clone
```

Use `.commentlint.yml` (`ignore:` path globs, `allow-phrases:`) only when the
same prose recurs across many sites. A reason is required either way — an
unexplained suppression is a finding nobody can re-evaluate later.

## Code Review

- [x] Run `/code-review` command (invokes cranky-code-reviewer agent)
- [x] All critical review-responses addressed
- [x] All significant review-responses addressed
- [x] Self-reviewed the diff for unrelated changes

**Review Responses:** code review RR-1M0PZ7 (critical), RR-UF6TCA, RR-RKIEXQ, RR-ASBQ8T, RR-0SD5RU (significant), RR-CE2WTD (minor), RR-C11LL8 (nit, deferred with reason); security review RR-ORMSKU (minor) and items folded into RR-CE2WTD. All critical and significant findings are fixed in commit 4ac90991. <!-- List IDs of review-response entities created, e.g.,

## Acceptance Verification

- [x] Each acceptance criterion tested (reference planning checklist)
- [x] Test evidence documented in implementation checklist

**Acceptance Status:**

1. Position on a pushable scope: PASS. `TestGraphPosition_OneStatementAtAnySize` (one statement at 5 and 60 rows), `TestPosition_StoreMatchesGoPath` (asc, desc, two keys, filters, absent and JSON-null keys, first, last, not in scope), `TestPosition_StoreDeclines`.
2. Position conformance on four backends: PASS (`RunGraphPositionTests`, incl. worlds, empty result).
3. Search: PASS. `TestSearch_RanksByConfiguredTitle` (case, per-type property, unmapped type, gated equals ungated), `TestSearch_RanksTitleMatchAboveBodyMention` without a map, `RunVisibleSearchTests` and `RunVisibleFieldSearchTests`.
4. Views: PASS. `TestViewBodies_*` (no full-entity read for a table view, per-collection bodies in one read, allowlist, command runner).
5. Gantt drill-down: PASS. Existing parity tests plus `TestGantt_SubtreeDrillBoundsItsEdgeRead`.
6. SQLite: PASS. storetest `RunAll`, `TestSimpleGraphSQL_MatchesNaive`, `TestSimpleGraphSQL_OrdersExactScalarsInSQL`, `TestSimpleGraphSQL_Gate`.
7. Re-measured table: in the ticket body.
<!-- For each acceptance criterion, state PASS/FAIL with evidence -->

## Documentation (enhancements only)

Skip this section for bugs and internal refactors.

- [x] Docs-checklist created and linked via `has-docs`
- [x] User-facing documentation updated
- [x] Docs-checklist marked as done

**Docs Checklist:** DOCS-40VA2Q <!-- e.g., DOCS-xxxx -->

## Final Checks

- [x] Commit message explains the why, not just what
- [x] No TODOs or FIXMEs left unaddressed
- [x] Ready for another developer to use

## Pull Request

- [x] Run `/pr` command to create PR and monitor CI

<!--
Deliberately NOT tracked here: the PR URL and whether CI passed.

Both post-date this checklist. `/pr` requires the ticket to be `done` and
validating clean before it opens the PR, and a `done` review-checklist may have
no unchecked items — so an item asking for the PR URL can only be satisfied by a
PR that does not exist yet. Checking it early would mean asserting "CI passed"
before CI ran, which turns the checklist from evidence into a formality.

GitHub records both authoritatively, and the branch and commit messages carry
the ticket ID, so the ticket-to-PR link is recoverable without duplicating it
here. See TKT-UFV01M. -->
