// Package lock is the named-mutual-exclusion seam: callers ask for a lock on a
// string key, do work, release. The backend is chosen at the wiring site per
// deployment tier, like [store.Store], state.KV and jobs.Queue.
//
// # Why keyed, and not another mutex
//
// Rela's pre-existing mutual exclusion is dataentry's writeMu: ONE process-wide
// mutex covering the whole write surface, held for the duration of a Lua
// action. It is both too coarse and too narrow.
//
// Too coarse, because unrelated writes serialize against each other. A burst of
// concurrent requests that touch entirely different entities queues up behind
// one lock and times out.
//
// Too narrow, because it is per-PROCESS. Several rela-server processes against
// one PostgreSQL database (see docs/postgres-backend.md) share no mutex at all,
// so it provides nothing there.
//
// A keyed lock addresses both: operations contend only when they name the SAME
// key, and the postgres backend serializes across processes. That is the whole
// point of the seam, and the reason [Locker] takes a key rather than being a
// plain mutex — a backend that ignored the key would be a correct-looking
// implementation of a useless contract, which is why locktest asserts that
// distinct keys do NOT contend.
//
// # Not a distributed lock service
//
// This is mutual exclusion, not consensus. There are no fencing tokens, no
// leases, and no liveness guarantee: a postgres advisory lock dies with its
// session, which is the correct failure mode here — a crashed holder releases
// rather than wedging every other process forever. Callers must not assume a
// held lock proves the holder is still making progress.

// Locker provides named mutual exclusion.
//
// Nil: never returned by a constructor — a New* function returns an error
// rather than a nil Locker, so a caller cannot silently run unserialized.
type Locker interface {
	// Acquire blocks until the lock named key is held, ctx is done, or the
	// backend fails.
	//
	// Bounding the wait is the CALLER's job, via ctx: a request path should
	// pass a deadline so a slow holder surfaces as a timeout rather than an
	// unbounded queue. Acquire returns ctx.Err() (wrapped) when the wait is
	// cut short, and callers distinguish that with errors.Is.
	//
	// Blocking is deliberate, and is the one place this seam departs from
	// pgstore's existing advisory-lock callers. Those use
	// pg_try_advisory_lock and SKIP when another holder has it, which is
	// right for a reconciliation sweep (someone else is already doing the
	// work) and wrong for a request path (skipping means silently dropping
	// the caller's work). A try-variant can be added if a caller genuinely
	// wants it; it is deliberately not the default.
	//
	// The returned release is idempotent and safe to defer. It is non-nil
	// exactly when err is nil.
	//
	// A lock is NOT reentrant: acquiring the same key twice from one
	// goroutine deadlocks. The weaker contract is promised on purpose —
	// a session-scoped postgres advisory lock happens to be reentrant per
	// session while an in-process mutex is not, so guaranteeing reentrancy
	// would make the backends behave differently in a way callers would
	// come to rely on.

// Backends hash or namespace the key differently — postgres feeds it to
// hashtext, an in-memory backend uses it as a map key, a future filesystem
// backend would resolve it to a path. Holding every backend to one rule is what
// stops a key working on one tier and failing after a migration to another; the
// shared suite in lock/locktest exercises the same key table against all of
// them.
//
// The rules mirror state.ValidateKey rather than inventing a second dialect,
// minus the filesystem-specific clauses that only matter when a key becomes a
// path. Keep them aligned: a caller deriving a lock key and a state key from
// the same source should not have to remember two contracts.
