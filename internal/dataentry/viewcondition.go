// ViewConditionMatcher evaluates one view's compiled `condition:` against a
// candidate row.
//
// Consumer-side (see docs/architecture/consumer-side-interfaces.md): dataentry
// declares the one method it needs and the composition root supplies the
// implementation, because the predicate engine that compiles and evaluates the
// expression sits above this package — arch-lint forbids dataentry importing
// `conditionlint` or `predicate`, the same reason next actions reach their
// compiled conditions through [ConditionPrefilterer].
//
// The method takes the request ctx because a condition may name
// `current_user`; the identity is derived from the principal on it by the
// implementation, so one derivation serves every row of the page.
//
// An evaluation error is RETURNED, never swallowed as "no match". A row that
// cannot be judged is not the same as a row judged false: silently dropping it
// would be the BUG-WHEREWIDE failure inverted, narrowing a view with no
// diagnostic. The caller decides what an error means for the request.
//
// MatchPage judges a whole page at once, so a condition using `related(...)`
// costs one store query per traversal rather than one per row. gate
// authorizes each traversal and match answers it; the verdicts come back in
// row order.

// The condition is evaluated against the REDACTED entity, never the raw
// stored one. Field redaction otherwise happens at serialization, long after
// this filter has already decided membership — and since a condition may name

// see would decide whether the row appears. That leaks the hidden value one
// bit at a time through row presence/absence, without it ever being
// serialized (the IB-review finding on #1593).
//
// Evaluating post-redaction is sound in the direction that matters: redaction
// REMOVES a hidden property, so it binds Nil, and every current-user form is
// false on Nil. The result is strictly narrower than an unredacted pass for
// those forms — the same asymmetry [ConditionPrefilterer] documents for next
// actions, reached here by the same remedy.
//
// The KEPT rows are the originals, not the redacted copies: redaction for the
// response happens at serialization, and substituting stripped entities here

// correct only for a caller that has already redacted or has no field policy;
// a caller holding one must pass it.
