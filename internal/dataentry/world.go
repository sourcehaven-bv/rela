//     debugging it than a uniform silence, and conceals nothing that the
//     operator's own repo does not already state.
//
//     `/api/v1/_schema` now enumerates the declared worlds (TKT-WRLDAPI), so
//     this 400 names something the same caller can already list. Note the

// in the direction of serving the wrong face" is the failure this arc keeps

// So the default is DENY, and a route joins this predicate only when its

// at — and names the rule that must have produced it. It never fetches, never
// walks the chain, and cannot disagree with the store about WHICH face was
// served, because it is handed that face.
//
// That distinction matters: a second chain walk here would be a second
// implementation of the semantics deciding which face a reader sees, free to
// drift from the store's. The mapping below is total over the states the
// store can return, so there is nothing left to decide:
//
//   - type absent from the scope -> rule 1, "unscoped".
//   - face present in the chain -> rule 2, "chain", plus its chain INDEX.
//   - otherwise -> rule 3 under `otherwise: default`, "fallback-default".
//
// The index is what distinguishes the world's first choice from a later
// candidate standing in for it — a distinction the rule name alone cannot
// carry. See [resolutionRuleAt].
//
// # Why the ZERO coordinate in a chain is not a problem
//
// A chain CAN contain the zero coordinate, and an earlier version of this
// comment asserted the opposite. `internal/worlds` maps each declared name
// through `entity.ParseFace` — but ParseFace validates the NAME, and
// what lands in the chain is `metamodel.StoredFace`, which maps a
// `bare_face` name to "" (that is where the default face genuinely
// lives — design doc §2.1, there are exactly N states and no extra row). So
// `select: [published, draft]` with `draft` marked default compiles to
// `Chain: ["published", ""]`.
//
// Totality does not need that invariant, because a zero coordinate in the
// chain is matched BY POSITION everywhere it matters, ahead of the fallback:
//
//   - here, slices.Index finds it and returns rule 2 with its real index;
//   - storeutil.WorldPrimes compares `coord != c.Face`, so a default row
//     matches the chain entry and takes its rank;
//   - pgstore's worldSQL emits `face = ” THEN i` for the chain entry
//     BEFORE the `otherwise: default` arm's `face = ” THEN len(chain)`,
//     and CASE takes the first match.
//
// The rank ordering is the load-bearing property, not the absence of "".
// Pinned by TestZeroInChain_Provenance (here), the storeutil chain tests, and
// TestWorldSQL_ZeroInChain (pgstore) — one per mechanism, because the three
// implementations agree by construction rather than by sharing code.
//
// The third arm is reachable only when the fallback actually fired: under
// `otherwise: exclude` the store returns NOTHING, so there is no response to
// label and the handler has already rendered a 404.
//
// # Why the face is DECLARED, not stored
//
// The wire's `face` is the name an operator wrote in `faces:`, not the
// coordinate the store keys on. Those differ for exactly one face — the one
// named by `bare_face:`, which IS the zero coordinate (design doc §2.1) and
// therefore serializes as "". Reporting the raw coordinate meant a row
// resolved to the bare face came back with an EMPTY face and `via: "chain"`,
// which no client can render: it is the world's first choice, correctly
// labeled as a chain hit, that cannot say WHICH face it is. Every consumer
// then fell back to printing the WORLD name, so `site-nl` serving an English
// page announced "site-nl" where "en" belonged (TKT-PI17Z6).
//
// [metamodel.DeclaredFace] is the inverse of the StoredFace mapping the world
// chain is compiled through, so this reads back the operator's own name rather

// The position is non-nil only for rule 2; the other rules did not resolve
// through the chain, so there is no rank to report and a zero would read as
// "first choice".
//
// # Why the rule alone was not enough
//
// "chain" says SOME selected coordinate exists, never WHICH. Under
// `select: [published, draft]` a real published face and a draft standing in
// for a missing one both reported "chain", so a `published`-world reader
// shown draft bytes could not tell — the silent substitution content states
// exist to prevent. `fallback-default` guards only the `otherwise:` arm,
// which fires when the chain matched NOTHING; a within-chain fallback slipped
// between the two.
//
// The index closes it without redefining anything: position 0 is the world's
// first choice, and any position > 0 is a within-chain fallback. Serving `en`
// from `[nl, en]` remains rule 2 — the world was OBEYED, not overridden, and
// calling it "fallback-default" would wrongly claim the `otherwise:` arm
// fired — but it is now visibly the second choice.
//
// This stays a LOOKUP, not a chain walk, for the reason [worldProvenance]
// gives: resolution already happened in the store, and re-deriving it here
// would be a second implementation of the semantics free to drift from it.
// slices.Index is the same read-back slices.Contains was, keeping the answer
// it had already computed instead of discarding it.
