// # Concurrency model
//
// The co-derived reload core (config, metamodel, style map, OpenAPI
// generator) lives in an immutable [Schema] published via [schemaProvider]'s
// atomic.Pointer. Handlers call a.State() once at entry and work against a
// coherent snapshot for the duration of the request — no lock acquisition, no
// risk of observing a half-reloaded world. Independently-owned reloadable
// state (logo, palette, user defaults) lives in its own self-synchronized
// service, not the snapshot.
//
// Reloads (triggered by the file watcher or by Reload) derive a new Schema
// and publish it atomically via a.schema.Reload. The previous snapshot is
// garbage-collected once no reader holds it.
//
// Mutations (CreateEntity, UpdateEntity, DeleteEntity, CreateRelation,
// UpdateRelation, DeleteRelation, SetProperty, action scripts) serialize
// via writeMu. writeMu excludes concurrent mutations but does NOT block
// readers — readers go through a.State(). The workspace's internal
// reloadMu coordinates the reload itself with the mutation path.
//
// TODO(TKT-R68TV8): App is a god-object. Decompose toward the
// 40-method load line — extract the API/serialization/relation services into
// their own types. Ratchet this number DOWN as methods move out; never up
// EXCEPT for a new required route handler (App owns one method per registered
// HTTP route by the router's design). The sync route cluster (16 methods) moved
// to syncHandler (170 → 154); the command cluster (11 methods) moved to
// commandHandler (154 → 143); the attachment cluster (12 methods) moved to
// attachmentHandler / package functions (143 → 131); the write nucleus —
// entity/relation CRUD, clone, conflict-resolve, and the modern relations
// reconciler (18 methods) — moved to writeHandler (131 → 114); the Lua
// action handler joined it (115 → 114, from a base that had absorbed the
// DEC-O59WM4 script-read helpers), completing the write surface: every
// writeMu write path now lives on or routes through writeHandler. The
// views cluster — view traversal, section building, the /_views,
// /_sidepanel, /_sidebar handlers, and the form-resolution helpers (16
// methods) — moved to viewsHandler, three receiver-free helpers became
// package functions, and the dead ungated server-rendered nav path (5
// methods, #1043) was deleted (114 → 90).
//
// The directive lags the real count (TKT-N0IKN9 tracks decomposing App); it is
// a ratchet target, not a budget to spend. SetUserState took it from 98 to 99 —
// it follows the existing SetSecurityConfig / SetJWTGate setter idiom rather
// than becoming a 12th positional NewApp parameter — and the CalDAV alias
// setter that landed alongside it took the count to 100, a later one to 101,
// and redactedForSuggestion to 102 — the field-redaction seam the next-action
// candidate path needs, which has to reach affordanceService.
//
// TKT-BDG8U9 adds [App.SetRemoteMCP] on the same terms — the public opt-in
// setter for the remote MCP endpoint, matching that setter idiom. The rest of
// that feature deliberately stays OFF App: `registerMCPRoute` takes its
// handler as a parameter and `toolForPath` is a package function, so the
// mount cost one method rather than three.
//
// TKT-DN37J2 adds [App.SetWorlds] on the same terms, and the same discipline
// held for the rest: `resolveWorld`, `attachWorld`, `worldCapablePath` and
// `worldRefusesSearch` are all package functions taking what they need, so
// request-level world selection cost ONE method rather than five.
//
// TKT-WRLDAPI item 4 (world-scoped relations) cost ZERO methods, and that was
// not free discipline — it was written as five methods first and plimsoll
// failed the build at 108/104. They became package functions taking their
// seams explicitly (`worldOutgoingForEntity`, `worldNeighborsForPage`,
// `includeCandidates`, `defaultWorldCandidates`, `worldCandidates`, plus
// `SetWorldNeighbors`), which reads better anyway: the seams a world-scoped
// link read depends on are named in the signature rather than reached through
// this struct. The load line doing its job is worth recording, because the
// habit it interrupts is the one that produced the 104.
