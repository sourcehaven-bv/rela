//     TestWebhookConflict_PipelineAppendsAllLand on every run; across processes
//     TestWebhookConflict_CrossProcessAppendsCanBeLost shows an append being

//
// The lock is therefore a stopgap for the append path, not the design. The fix
// is store-level optimistic concurrency (TKT-34XS2R): an expected-version on
// entity.Patch carried into store.UpdateEntity, so the append becomes a real
// CAS and this lock can go. Nothing here should grow to depend on the lock in

//
// The re-read narrows the read-compute-write to this call. Be precise about

//
//   - In-process it is BELT AND BRACES. writeMu serializes deliveries, and each
//     retry attempt re-runs findWebhookTarget, so on the find path `target`
//     already carries a fresh body. Disabling the re-read does not fail the
//     concurrency test, and that is expected.
//   - On the CREATE path it is load-bearing in a different way: `target` there
//     is the entity as constructed, whose Content does not reflect what
//     templates and on-create automations actually persisted. Splicing onto the
//     stored body is what keeps a template-provided section from being dropped.
//   - ACROSS processes a residual window remains, because nothing here is a
//     compare-and-swap. Closing it needs a server-side append mode on
//     entity.Patch, which the ticket names as a follow-up, not a v1 requirement.
