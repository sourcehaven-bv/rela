// attachmentHandler serves the entity-attachment routes
// (/api/v1/{plural}/{id}/_attachments/...): upload, download, detach.
// Extracted from App (TKT-R68TV8) to shrink the god object.
//
// It holds the full store.Store because attachment.New (the shared HTTP/CLI
// write-policy service) requires it. The write handle is NOT the full manager:
// this handler never calls it, only passes it to attachment.New, so it holds
// exactly attachment's own one-method attachment.EntityPatcher (TKT-IVSJV6). The
// swappable collaborators (acl, audit sink, field resolver, command runner) are closures over
// App so tests that reassign app.acl / app.fieldResolver after construction
// stay effective — same rationale as affordanceService. gateRead is App's
// shared uniform-404 read gate (handlers_attachment and the entity read path
// must 404 identically for hidden and nonexistent ids).
