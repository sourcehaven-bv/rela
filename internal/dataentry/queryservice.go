// queryService owns the search-query pipeline: the `/_search` and
// `_position`-scope entry point (executeQuery), its free-text branch, the
// list endpoint's `?q=` id-set helper, and the metamodel-aware sort and
// property-filter passes those share. Extracted from App (TKT-SJ0LRS, part
// of the TKT-R68TV8 decomposition arc).
//
// Consolidating them here is the point of the extraction: the read handlers,
// the next-action engine (nextaction.go) and the `_position` scope resolver
// (scope.go) now share ONE collaborator instead of each reaching back into
// App for the same closures.
//
// Collaborator rationale differs from the sibling handlers in one respect
// that is load-bearing. The ACL-scoped searcher and the affordance service
// are held as CLOSURES rather than values, because tests reassign
// `app.visibleSearcher` (see rebindVisibleSearcher) and `app.affordances`
// after construction; a captured value would silently keep the searcher from
// construction time and a test injecting a recording/denying searcher would
// exercise the wrong one.
//
// The searcher seam is deliberately [search.VisibleSearcher], never a plain
// search.Searcher: executeQuery's free-text branch must only ever see hits
// the request principal may read (TKT-BA8BSX). This type also holds NO
// store.Store FIELD — it never carries an independent store handle, so a
// read cannot bypass the request-scoped bundle. The store reads it does
// perform arrive through the Services bundle passed in per call, whose
// gating is applied by the free functions in helpers.go
// (visibleListByTypes / visibleEntitiesOfType) against the resolved scope.

// executeQuery parses a search query and returns all matching entities.
// It supports the same query syntax as the search page: type:, prop:, status:,
// and free text. Free-text words use OR logic with fuzzy matching via Bleve;
// results are ranked by score.
//
// It runs the search-view pipeline under the ctx principal's
// read scope (TKT-BA8BSX). Every consumer — handleV1Search, the
// _position search scope (resolveScope), and the next-action engine —
// inherits the gate from here, so no future consumer can run an ungated
// search by accident.
//
// Ordering of the gate: the scope resolves FIRST, and an
// all-effective-DenyAll scope returns before any backend work — a
// denied principal must not be able to probe search-backend latency
// (RR-X56H pattern, pinned with a recording searcher in
// acl_search_test.go). The free-text branch then runs through
// search.VisibleSearcher so hidden hits never have their bodies
// loaded; the type-listing branch resolves the per-type verdict
// against the store directly.
//
// The maxFreeTextSearchResults bound counts entities that survived
// BOTH visibility and property filters (post-visibility truncation —
// a pre-visibility cap starves restricted principals; a pre-filter
// cap would starve filtered queries the same way).
//
// Errors: visibility-scope failures wrap errACLListQuery (mapped by
// writeGateError: cancel-silent / 504 / 500 acl_query_failed with
// constant detail), store-load failures wrap errListLoad, and plain
// search-backend failures pass through (500 search_failed). The
// pre-TKT-BA8BSX version swallowed both error classes into silently
// truncated results.
