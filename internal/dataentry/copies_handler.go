// copyService is the copy capability this package needs, declared HERE at the
// call site rather than taken from entitymanager wholesale (TKT-WRLDAPI
// item 5).
//
// # Why not the EntityManager interface
//
// [entitymanager.EntityManager] is the ordinary-CRUD write contract — create,
// update, delete, patch. A copy is a distinct operation, so widening that
// shared interface for one consumer would force every implementer and test
// double to grow two methods they will never call. The precedent is one file
// over in the composition root: EntityManager goes in wide while
// `lua.WriteDeps.EntityManager` is the narrower `lua.Mutator`, satisfied
// structurally.
//
// # It is satisfied by the CONCRETE manager, deliberately
//
// [entitymanager.Manager.CopiesForSource] computes each offer's `Allowed` by
// running the manager's own unexported planning and authorization path — the
// same code the invoke uses. That is what makes the hint unable to drift from
// the write. A design in which this package computed invocability itself would
// type-check and would be exactly the RULING 11 defect: an affordance map that
// says one thing while the write path does another.

// copiesHandler serves the copy surface: list-by-source and invoke-by-name.
//
// # Nil is a WIRING BUG, not a mode
//
// The service is required at construction ([newCopiesHandler] rejects nil)
// rather than nil-checked per request, because the alternative renders a
// wiring failure as a VALID DOMAIN ANSWER: an empty offer list is exactly what
// a face with no declared copies returns, so a missing service would present
// as "the promote button never appears" and send someone hunting through
// schema.yaml for a definition that is correctly declared.
//
// That is the project's constructor rule ("never substitute a no-op or
// sentinel implementation silently — that defers the failure to a downstream
// symptom that is much harder to diagnose"), and it is the same shape as the
// silence-shaped defects this epic has been closing: a check, or a capability,
// whose absence looks like a legitimate result.

// that produces them.
//
// The concrete manager is required because Allowed must run the kernel's own

// copyInvokeRequest is the invoke body. It names a DEFINITION and the entities
// it applies to — never a definition's contents.
//
// That is the transforms-registry precedent: a request may choose a registered
// NAME, never supply the thing itself. If a caller could describe a copy, they
// could describe one whose guard is convenient, and the guard system would be
// decorative. [entitymanager.CopyRequest] is three strings for the same
// reason, so this shape is enforced by the type it maps onto.
type copyInvokeRequest struct {
	SourceID string `json:"source_id"`
	// TargetID is required for a CROSS-ENTITY copy and must be empty for a
	// same-entity one, whose target is the source by construction. The kernel
	// validates this; the field is here so a caller can express it.
	TargetID string `json:"target_id,omitempty"`
}

// invoke executes a declared copy.
//
// # It does NOT re-check the guard, and that is the point
//
// [entitymanager.Manager.CopyState] authorizes internally — a read gate on the
// source, the definition's `guard:` resolved per-entity, and a create check on
// a cross-entity target — and it fails closed when a guarded definition has no
// guard wired. Adding a second check here would create two authorization sites
// that can disagree, which is strictly worse than one: the divergence would be
// invisible, since both would look plausible.
//
// So this handler's whole job on the security axis is to call the kernel and
// TRANSLATE its verdict. The mapping is deliberately asymmetric:
//
//   - [acl.ForbiddenError] -> 403, naming the rule. A copy definition and its
//     guard permission are operator-authored config, so saying which
//     permission was missing helps the operator and conceals nothing.
//   - [entitymanager.ErrCopySourceMissing] -> 404, INDISTINGUISHABLE from a
//     genuinely absent entity. The kernel already collapses "denied" into this
//     error for exactly that reason; rendering it as a 403 here would undo the
//     read gate's work and turn this endpoint into an existence oracle.
//   - the kernel's request-shape sentinels (unknown definition, missing or
//     disallowed target id, target of another type) and a validation
//     failure -> 422, the ordinary "coherent request this surface cannot
//     satisfy", with the kernel's own text (it names config and caller ids).
//   - everything else -> 500 with a generic detail; the real error is logged,
//     because a wrapped store error in the body leaks backend internals.
