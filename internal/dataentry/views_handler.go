//
// This is a UX filter and NOTHING ELSE. It decides what to RENDER, never what
// to allow. If you want an authorization check, this is the wrong function —
// build one, and see authorizeCommand for the shape.
//
// Hiding an element changes no enforcement: its target is reachable by typing
// the URL and behaves exactly as it did before — a list still returns its
// ACL-scoped rows, which for a principal who may read none of them is simply an
// empty list, and a dashboard card's query still runs through the ACL-scoped
// search path. Nor does it conceal configuration: `/api/v1/_config` keeps
// serving the whole navigation tree and `dashboard:` block to every principal,
// deliberately (root CLAUDE.md, "The configuration is not a secret; the data
// is"). The goal is only to keep things a user cannot act on out of their way.
//
// Policy, keyed on the configured ACL implementation, mirroring
// authorizeCommand (DEC-EIHQSU):
//
//   - No `permission:` → show. The overwhelmingly common case, short-circuited
//     before any ACL work so an unconfigured menu costs nothing.
//   - [acl.NopACL] and [acl.ReadOnlyACL] → show. NEITHER carries a policy, so
//     there is no permission model to consult and no principal who could be
//     shown to hold anything: "no policy configured ⇒ no restrictions", the
//     same posture the read gate takes. See the read-only note below.
//   - [*acl.Declarative] → the principal must hold the permission.
//   - anything else → hide.
//
// Read-only deserves its own paragraph, because the obvious arm is wrong in
// two different ways and this predicate is a copy target.
//
// It is tempting to mirror authorizeCommand, which denies everything under
// ReadOnlyACL. That is right for commands — they SHELL OUT, a write-shaped act
// — but [acl.ReadOnlyACL] only implements AuthorizeWrite; it restricts no
// reads whatsoever. The gated elements are overwhelmingly read surfaces (list,
// kanban, dashboard, search, dashboard cards), and hiding them would remove
// things an observe-only principal can use perfectly well. It would also hide
// them from EVERYONE, since ReadOnlyACL has no identity to check — so
// `permission:` would silently
// change meaning from "hide from non-holders" to "hide from all" based on a
// process-wide flag about writes. An operator in post-incident forensic mode
// (a documented ReadOnlyACL use case) would lose exactly the audit-log entry
// they came for.
//
// The hazard the deny arm was reaching for is real but belongs elsewhere: under
// ReadOnlyACL no middleware attaches a read gate, so readGateFromContext hands
// back nopReadGate, whose HoldsPermission returns true unconditionally
// (RR-CWWJGW). Falling THROUGH to the gate would therefore show gated entries
// while looking like it had checked something. The explicit arm above is what
// prevents that: the answer is the same, but it is reached deliberately rather
// than by an accident that would keep working if the gate's behavior changed.
//
// The switch is closed by construction: an ACL implementation nobody taught
// this function about hides gated entries rather than showing them. Both value
// and face forms of the nop/read-only types are matched, because their
// AuthorizeWrite has a value receiver — matching only the value form would
// drop a `&acl.ReadOnlyACL{}` into the default arm.

// can create has no ACL question worth asking, so this also keeps the ACL
