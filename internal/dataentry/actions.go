	// this endpoint a read-side ACL bypass: any caller who may POST an action
	// could name any id and have its properties land in script scope, echoed
	// back through the action's own response.
	//
	// visibility.ScriptReader is the seam that answers all of this correctly,
	// and reusing it beats hand-rolling a gate here:
	//
	//   - it gates on the STORED type, so a caller cannot claim a type they may
	//     read to reach an id of a type they may not (BUG-ZWTDH9's defect);
	//   - it REDACTS `visible:`-hidden fields, which a row-level PermitsRead
	//     check does not — the script must not see values the caller cannot;
	//   - a denied entity comes back as store.ErrNotFound, indistinguishable
	//     from a genuine miss, so this endpoint is not an existence oracle.
	//
	// A denied or absent id therefore leaves ent nil and the action still RUNS,
	// exactly as when no entity_id was supplied. That is deliberate: entity_id
	// is an optional parameter, not the resource. Refusing the whole request
	// would break list actions whose script ignores `entity` — the SPA sends an
	// id for every selected row, so one unreadable row in a selection would
	// otherwise fail an operation the caller is fully entitled to perform.
