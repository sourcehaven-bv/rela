	//     and never for a world — a provenance block would be noise.
	//   - A history snapshot is rebuilt from a stored version and carries no
	//     face, so labeling it would state a coordinate the code cannot
	//     back — the "affordance map that lies" failure, one layer down.
	//   - Views, attachments and restore are not world-capable routes.
