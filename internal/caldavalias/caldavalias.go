// Package caldavalias maps CalDAV resources to rela entities.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// The rela→CalDAV direction is derivable: a resource href and UID are minted
// from the entity's type and id. The inbound direction is not. A to-do created
// in a client arrives with a client-minted identifier — verified against Apple
// Reminders, which uses a bare UUID (`D8AAE77A-89CB-46D2-BDA4-F319D2014D6B`) as
// both the UID and the resource filename. rela entity ids must start with a
// letter or digit, so such a UUID can never BE an entity id. The link has to be
// stored.
//
// # Shape
//
// This is its own service rather than a field on an existing one, and it is
// deliberately NOT a [store.EntityObserver] registered on the store. It follows
// store.VersionService: an injected concern the composition root threads
// through, which consumers bind to via narrow interfaces declared at their own
// call sites. Versioning already made this move — appbuild takes the service
// "rather than type-asserting the store — versioning is a separate injected
// concern, not a store capability."
//
// # What it does not store
//
// The entity TYPE is absent by design. A CalDAV collection declares exactly one
// entity_type (see dataentryconfig.CalDAVCollection), so a request already knows
// the type from the collection before it consults an alias. The alias answers
// only WHICH entity.

// client resource loses its entity link, so the next sync re-creates every
// to-do as a NEW entity and the user's list silently doubles. That is the same
// reasoning internal/cli/sync applies to its own state: silently discarding it

// write refreshed it, so any rela-side edit (SPA, CLI, MCP, automation, git
// pull) left it stale. The client then either presented the freshly-served tag
// and got a permanent 412, or presented the stale one and silently overwrote
// the newer edit. The tag a conditional request compares against must be
// derived from entity content at the moment of the request — see
// caldavBackend.currentETag.

	// (Apple mints a bare UUID), so there is no reason two principals should
	// share that namespace even when they sync the same collection — and once
	// a `where:` clause can bind to the caller (an `@me` filter), "one
	// collection" stops being true at all: the same config key resolves to a
	// different member set per principal, so the alias table must be able to
	// represent that they are different collections.
	//
	// Empty is a legitimate value: an unauthenticated single-user deployment
	// has no principal, and all its aliases share the empty key space.

// Safe for concurrent use. It holds the whole table in memory behind a mutex
// and persists on every mutation, because [state.KV] offers no read-modify-write
// primitive: FSKV writes are individually atomic (temp→fsync→rename via SafeFS)
// but nothing coordinates two concurrent Puts. The in-process mutex is what
// makes a merge safe here, exactly as settingsService, paletteService and
// logoStore each do for their own state.
//
// CROSS-PROCESS CAVEAT: that mutex does not span processes. Two rela servers on
// one project can still clobber each other's alias writes. Acceptable today
// because CalDAV is served by one process; a multi-writer deployment wants the
// postgres-backed variant noted on TKT-WAA092.
