// TestCopiesForSource_AffordanceProbeEmitsNoAuditRecords is the regression
// test for a defect code review found: a READ-ONLY list emitted `denied-write`
// audit records.
//
// # Why it happened
//
// `Allowed` is computed by running the real authorization path — that is what
// stops the hint drifting from the write. But that path AUDITS its denials, so
// asking the question recorded an answer as though someone had attempted a
// write. A SPA rendering an entity view would append N rows per page load.
//
// # Why it matters more than volume
//
// `op=denied-write` would stop meaning "someone tried to write and was
// refused" and start meaning "someone looked at a page". Anyone alerting on
// denied-write volume gets paged by ordinary browsing, and the real signal
// drowns. The audit log's value is that it does not lie.
//
// The verdict is still computed identically — only the RECORD is suppressed —
// so the hint cannot drift as a result of this fix.
//
// # Mutation-checked, and the result is worth recording
//
// Removing the suppression in authorizeAndAudit does NOT fail this test, and
// that is not a flaw in the assertion — it is because the OTHER fix from the
// same review (filtering cross-entity definitions out before authorization)
// removed the path that audited. The records came from planCopyEdges on
// CROSS-ENTITY definitions, and those are no longer probed at all.
//
// So today the suppression is BELT-AND-BRACES, not the mechanism. It stays
// because the reachable-path set is a property of the current call graph
// rather than of the design: anything that probes a definition performing a
// per-edge authorization re-opens the path immediately, and the failure would
// be silent pollution of an append-only log.
