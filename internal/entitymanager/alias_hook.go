// AliasRewriter is notified when an entity's identity changes, so a subsystem
// that stores references BY ENTITY ID can rewrite them.
//
// Declared here at the consumer rather than next to its implementation
// (internal/caldavalias): Manager depends on exactly the two methods it calls.
// The wiring site supplies a CalDAV alias service when one is configured, and
// leaves this nil otherwise.
//
// # Why a hook and not an observer
//
// [store.EntityObserver.EntityRenamed] carries the same information, but every
// store fires it as `_ = o.EntityRenamed(...)` — the error is discarded, so a
// failed rewrite is silent. That is the right trade for a search index, which
// can be rebuilt. It is the wrong trade here: a lost CalDAV alias makes a
// client re-create the resource as a NEW entity, silently duplicating a user's
// to-do with no signal anywhere.
//
// # Best-effort, unlike the alias service itself
//
// A rewrite failure is LOGGED, not propagated: a rename that already touched
// the store cannot be unwound here, so failing the call would report an error
// for a write that did happen. The alias service returns its errors so this
// hook can surface them; the hook stops short of failing the rename. The
// residual risk — a rename that succeeds while its alias rewrite fails — leaves
// an orphaned alias that a client sees as a delete plus a create.
