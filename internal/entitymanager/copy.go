// copyEngine owns the copy operation: planning, authorization, target
// construction, edge planning and audit.
//
// # Why a separate type (Jeroen's call, TKT-WRLDAPI item 5)
//
// It is a decomposition, not a lint workaround. Copies are already a distinct
// operation — deliberately outside the ordinary-CRUD write contract — and this
// makes that boundary structural rather than conventional. Since TKT-IVSJV6
// removed the wide producer-side `EntityManager` interface, that contract is
// no longer one declared type: each consumer narrows to what it calls, and the
// copy path has its own ([CopyReader], [CopyGuard], [CopyReadGate]) rather
// than riding along on the CRUD ones. `Manager` was at 41 methods against a 40 load
// line, almost all of them private helpers; adding the copy-affordance query
// would have pinned it at the line rather than under it, and the load line is
// a ratchet to narrow, not a budget to spend.
//
// # It holds the Manager, and that is deliberate
//
// The engine needs `authorizeAndAudit`, which is Manager's and is shared with
// every other write path. Duplicating it here would be a second authorization
// implementation — the exact defect this feature's design refuses. So the
// engine composes the manager rather than replacing it.
//
// # planCopy and authorizeCopy stay UNEXPORTED
//
// That is load-bearing, not incidental. [CopiesForSource] computes each
// offer's `Allowed` by running those two — the same code the invoke runs — and
// that is the only reason the hint cannot drift from the write (RULING 11).
// Exporting them, or making invocability computable from outside this package,
// would let a caller answer the question a different way and reintroduce the
// two-authorization-sites defect.

// CopyState executes a declared copy definition: write a mapped subset of one
// content state (face) into another, in ONE store transaction, audited.
//
// # The kernel is dumb; the definition carries the policy
//
// Everything policy-shaped — which fields, merge vs replace, the guard —
// lives in the compiled definition. This function writes what it is told.
// That split is what lets the security tests aim at one small function
// rather than at a mapping language.
//
// # store.Tx, and a note for reviewers
//
// entitymanager had NEVER called store.Tx before this (the only non-store
// caller in the tree was internal/datamigration). That is deliberate here,
// not an oversight: a copy writes fields, body and edges, and a half-applied
// copy is a face that claims to be a promotion of something it is not.
//
// Two consequences the contract forces:
//
//   - Every store call inside the transaction goes through the VIEW, never
//     ce.m.deps.Store. A write on the outer store from inside deadlocks on
//     fs/mem and silently bypasses the transaction on pg.
//   - fs/mem have NO ROLLBACK — store.Tx there is a write mutex. A mid-copy
//     failure leaves a partially written target face on those backends. That
//     is the accepted best-effort stance for fsstore (§6.1); pgstore gives
//     real atomicity.
//
// # Audit lands AFTER the commit
//
// A rollback that left an audit record would make the log claim a write that
// never happened, which is worse than a missing record — the log's whole
// value is that it does not lie. This matches the existing "audit the
// durable write" rule, extended past a transaction boundary.
//
// # What this does NOT do
//
// It does not validate the DESTINATION WORLD. §9.2 says a copy into a state
// a world selects is valid iff that world remains a valid graph, but
// `must_hold_in` is TKT-9KZGJO's declared seam and shipping half of it here
// would fork it. That is a boundary, not an omission.

// definition happens to omit one, which is the hole an earlier cut of this
// function shipped: a principal holding nothing could promote a stranger's
// draft, including fields they could not read.
//
//  1. READ on the source, always. A copy is a read followed by a write, and
//     the elevation split is about which FIELDS travel, not about whether
//     the principal may touch the entity at all. Without this, elevation
//     becomes a way to read what you cannot read.
//  2. The definition's `guard:`, resolved per-entity via
//     HoldsPermissionForEntity, so "the owner of THIS doc may publish it"
//     works without a global grant. Mandatory at LOAD for any definition
//     targeting a non-default face, so the sentence above always applies.
//  3. WRITE on the target, as the ordinary verb the copy performs: `create`
//     when the target face does not exist yet, `update` when it does. A
//     cross-entity copy creates or overwrites an entity with its own
//     audience, so it must not become a way to write entities the principal
//     could not write by hand — and "by hand" includes overwriting an
//     existing one, which is why the probe precedes this function.
//
// A same-entity copy into a GUARDED (non-bare) face is exempt from (3): nobody
// holds `update` on published by design, so requiring it would make every
// promote impossible, and (2) — mandatory at load for exactly these
// definitions — stands in its place. A same-entity copy into the BARE face is
// NOT exempt: the bare face is the one ordinary writes address, no guard is
// required to declare such a copy, and without (3) an unguarded `revert`
