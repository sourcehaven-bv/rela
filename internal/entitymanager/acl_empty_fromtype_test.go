// TestCreateRelation_EmptyFromType_AgainstTypeScopedPolicy pins TKT-ZJXO19
// (gh#1129): a relation write whose SOURCE ENTITY DOES NOT EXIST must never be
// authorized more permissively than the same write with the real source type.
//
// # Why this needs its own test
//
// CreateRelation computes a best-effort — possibly empty — FromType before the
// ACL check, so authorization does not depend on peer existence (BUG-K6FEVB).
// The existing regression tests cover that only against ReadOnlyACL (denies
// everything) and NopACL (allows everything). Neither is type-scoped, so
// neither can show what an EMPTY FromType does against a realistic acl.yaml
// with specific per-type grants — which is the only configuration where the
// question has an answer.
//
// The reasoning that this is safe holds: grantsVerb matches `t == "*" ||
// t == target`, so an empty target can only hit a wildcard grant (already
// permissive without the change) or a literal empty-string grant (not a real
// configuration). But that was PROSE. Nothing failed if a future change to
// grantsVerb, or to how FromType is derived, made "" match something it should
// not — and the ACL has been in production since 2026-07-07.
//
// The table pairs each policy with both source states so the comparison is
// direct: for every policy, absent-source must be no more permissive than
// present-source.
//
// # What this does and does not catch
//
// Honest scope, established by mutation rather than assumed. Substituting "*"
// for an empty FromType inside authorizeRelationWrite — the concrete bypass
// shape the issue imagines — is caught only by the `create: [""]` row, because
// with a realistic `create: [decision]` grant an empty type fails to match
// either way. Catching the wildcard substitution on a realistic grant would
// need a client-baseline ceiling (the one mechanism that denies a type a role
// holds `*` on), which is a different subsystem and belongs with the ceiling's
// own tests.
//
// What this test DOES pin is the property the issue asked for: across every
// realistic grant shape, an unresolvable source is never authorized where the
// resolved one is refused — and the one configuration where that is untrue is
// named, not silently absent.
