// cycle — which is why dataentry's own test suite asserts the adapter
// satisfies it (TestNextAction_CurrentUserConditionEndToEnd).
//
// Neither method derives an identity. Both read the [predicatefns.QueryIdentity]
// that [nextActionRequestScope] stamped ONCE per request, so the pre-filter
// and the Go pass cannot disagree about whose rows they select, and a
// resolve over N candidates costs one derivation, not N.

// from the per-source [nextaction.ErrIdentityRequired] an unauthenticated

// It does NOT call the ACL resolver: on the data-entry API the router has
// already run resolvePrincipalEntity, so principal.User IS the resolved user
// entity id when the policy has a user_entity_type and the principal matched
// one, with RawUser holding the original identifier. When no resolution
// happened, User is the raw identifier and that is what graph data can be
// compared against (predicatefns.QueryIdentity documents the fallback).
//
// Two states yield no identity, and both must: an unstamped ctx, and the
// "unknown" attribution placeholder the data-entry server stamps when it has
// no identity source. Neither is a user, and comparing either against
// `entity.assignee` would be a match against nobody at best and against an
// entity literally assigned to "unknown" at worst.
//
// One degradation is inherited from the router and worth knowing: when the
// principal_property lookup fails with a BACKEND error, resolvePrincipalEntity
// keeps the raw principal, so this derives the raw identifier while the
// operator's condition compares against user-entity ids. The source then
// matches NOTHING for that request (narrowing, never widening) rather than
// erroring; predicatefns.ResolveQueryIdentity is the stricter shape the
// boundary stamp (TKT-ZQV9O5) should adopt.
