// Package principal carries the identity attribution attached to each
// request: who initiated it (User) and through what entry point
// (Tool). Entry-point binaries stamp a [Principal] on the request
// context once at startup (or per-request for HTTP-style entry
// points); downstream consumers — audit logging today, access control
// in subsequent PRs — read it via [From].
//
// This package is deliberately small. It owns the [Principal] type,
// the Tool* constants, the context plumbing, and the OS-user lookup.
// It does NOT carry session lifecycle, role mapping, or
// authentication — those are separate concerns that may grow their
// own packages.
//
// **Growth gated on ACL.** The package was extracted from `audit`
// specifically so a future ACL ticket can import [Principal] without
// pulling audit. If that ticket gets de-prioritized and no second
// consumer materializes, this package should be reabsorbed into the
// consumer that uses it most — currently `audit`. Don't grow this
// package speculatively.
//
// That gate has since opened, once (TKT-RP3X3Q): [Principal] gained the
// verified-assertion claims — orgID, orgSlug, roles — because internal/acl
// needs to grant roles from a signed identity assertion, and the claims have
// nowhere else to live that both the ACL evaluator and the audit log can read.
// The unexported-fields-plus-[Verified] shape exists so the trust boundary is
// enforced by the compiler; see the [Principal] doc.
//
// The gate is not now open generally. `roles` earned its place by having an
// evaluator; `orgID`/`orgSlug` ride along for audit attribution only and are
// the outer limit of what belongs here. Session lifecycle, provisioning, and
// role *expansion* remain out — they are separate concerns with their own
// packages.
//
// It opened a second time (TKT-IAC8TX) on the same terms: `principalType` and
// `scopes` earned their place by having an evaluator — internal/acl compiles
// them into a client-attenuation ceiling. `client_id` was considered and left
// out precisely because nothing evaluates it; it would be attribution-only
// clutter, and the ceiling can key on it later if that changes.

// Principal identifies who is making a write. User is the OS user
// captured at process startup via [SystemUser]; data-entry overrides it
// per-request from an HTTP middleware. Tool identifies the entry point —
// one of the Tool* constants below.
//
// RawUser records the pre-resolution identifier when the ACL policy's
// `principal_property` lookup substituted User with a graph entity ID
// (e.g. the `X-Forwarded-User` email before it became a `PERS-…` ID). It
// is empty when no substitution happened — the common case — and exists
// so the audit log can record BOTH the identity that authenticated and
// the entity it resolved to without a round-trip to the graph. Old audit
// consumers ignore the `raw_user` key (omitempty).
//
// # Verified assertion claims
//
// orgID, orgSlug, roles, principalType and scopes carry claims from a
// CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY VERIFIED identity assertion. They are unexported on
// purpose: [VerifiedFrom] (and its [Verified] wrapper) is the only way to
// populate them, so no composite literal anywhere in the tree can forge a role.
// That matters because internal/acl trusts a Principal absolutely — it verifies
// nothing itself — so a role reaching it from an unverified source (a spoofable
// header, say) would be a complete authorization bypass. The compiler enforces
// the trust boundary here rather than leaving it to a code reviewer's memory.
//
// Read them via [Principal.OrgID], [Principal.OrgSlug], [Principal.Roles],
// [Principal.PrincipalType], [Principal.Scopes].
//
// The two attenuation claims run the OPPOSITE direction from roles: principalType
// selects a ceiling that removes capability, and scopes re-open pieces of it
// bounded by the acting user. So a forged one could only ever narrow — but they
// share the constructor discipline anyway, because "this claim is safe to forge"
// is not a property worth asking a future reader to re-derive.
