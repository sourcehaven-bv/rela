// GateTraversal compiles an untrusted traversal request into a store

//
// # Why this exists
//
// A traversal filters on properties of entities the query does NOT return.
// Nothing about the neighbor is ever serialized, so response redaction never
// fires — the leak is the CORRELATION between the filter and the result set,
// and it is binary-searchable: repeated queries narrow a hidden value
// arbitrarily. Two secrets are at stake, both named in docs/acl-security.md:
// a hidden entity's EXISTENCE, and a redacted field's VALUE.
//
// Three rules, all required, none sufficient alone:
//
//  1. ROW GATE. Each hop's read query for its entity type is ANDed into that
//     hop, so a traversal can only match neighbors the principal may read.
//     DenyAll on any hop fails the whole traversal closed.
//  2. FIELD GATE. A property whose `visible:` grant is CONDITIONAL is not
//     filterable, at all, by anyone. The row gate does not help here: the
//     principal can see the row and still not be entitled to the value, and a
//     filter would reveal it. See [Policy.ConditionallyVisible]. The policy
//     is the Request's own, so no caller can skip this by passing none.
//  3. NO INHERITANCE EXPANSION. Every hop's gate sits inside an endpoint
//     match — a NESTED position, where no backend emits InheritThrough or
//     EntityInheritThrough. A read granted through inheritance is therefore
//     [ErrTraversalUnsupported], never silently dropped.
//
// A denied read on ANY hop returns [ErrTraversalDenied]; a read the
// predicate cannot express returns [ErrTraversalUnsupported]. Neither ever
// widens.
