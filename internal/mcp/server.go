// Package mcp implements the Model Context Protocol server exposed by
// `rela mcp` over stdio.
//
// The server exposes rela's capabilities to AI assistants:
//
//   - Tools for entity/relation CRUD, graph trace/path, analysis (orphans,
//     cardinality, properties, validations, unique, schema usage), schema
//     introspection, and Lua execution. Registered in tools.go (grep AddTool).
//   - Resources: rela://metamodel, rela://entity/{type}/{id},
//     rela://relation/{from}/{type}/{to}
//   - Prompts: analyze-traceability, review-orphans, summarize-project,
//     review-entity
//   - A file watcher over entities/, relations/, and the schema file with
//     a 200ms debounce; tests that exercise the watcher must wait past it
//     (see watcher.go).
//
// The server handles its own project init (discovery, metamodel load,
// store wiring) independently from the standard CLI PersistentPreRunE.

	// Behavior change vs mark3labs (TKT-UIR41P, documented delta): the
	// previous library exposed SendNotificationToAllClients, which this
	// callback used to push notifications/resources/list_changed on every
	// file change. The go-sdk has no equivalent — it emits list_changed
	// automatically when the resource SET changes (AddResource /
	// RemoveResources), which is a different event from "the contents
	// behind a resource template changed", and offers no exported way to
	// send an ad-hoc one.
	//
	// Resources here are a static list plus two URI templates, so the set
	// never changes at runtime; only contents do. Rather than fake a
	// set-change to trigger the notification, the callback now just logs.
	// Clients re-read on demand and see fresh data, because every read
	// goes to the store. The practical loss is that a client caching a
	// resource list is not proactively invalidated — acceptable, and
	// aligned with the direction of the 2026-07-28 spec, which requires an
	// explicit subscriptions/listen opt-in for these notifications anyway.
