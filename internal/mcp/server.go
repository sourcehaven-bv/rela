// Package mcp implements the Model Context Protocol server exposed by
// `rela mcp` over stdio.
//
// The server exposes rela's capabilities to AI assistants:
//
//   - Tools for entity/relation CRUD, graph trace/path, analysis (orphans,
//     cardinality, properties, validations, schema), schema introspection,
//     export, and Lua execution. Registered in tools.go (grep AddTool).
//   - Resources: rela://metamodel, rela://entity/{type}/{id},
//     rela://relation/{from}/{type}/{to}
//   - Prompts: analyze-traceability, review-orphans, summarize-project,
//     review-entity
//   - A file watcher over entities/, relations/, and the schema file with
//     a 200ms debounce; tests that exercise the watcher must wait past it
//     (see watcher.go).
//
// The server handles its own project init (discovery, metamodel load,
// store wiring) independently from the standard CLI PersistentPreRunE.

//
// 48 → 49: [Server.HTTPHandler] (TKT-BDG8U9). It belongs on Server — it
// exposes THIS server over a second transport, the peer of [Server.Serve] —
// and it is the only method the remote endpoint added: the stateless-transport
// choice lives inside it, and the wiring site holds an http.Handler rather
// than reaching for the SDK.
//
// 49 → 38 (TKT-YUETL7): the type-name helpers moved to typeResolver (they
// need only the metamodel) and the trace/export tool handlers moved to
// traceHandler / exportHandler (store + tracer, and store + resolver,
// respectively). Each is a field below, wired from Deps in [NewServer];
// registerTools points the affected AddTool lines at the field's methods.
//
// 38 → 25 (TKT-MGNE5L): the lua tools moved to luaHandler (the sole user of
// LuaWriteDeps / LuaCache / ProjectRoot), the schema tools + resource reads
// to schemaResourceHandler (store + metamodel), and the prompt handlers to
// promptHandler (store + metamodel + tracer + resolver). register* stay on
// Server and point at the fields' methods. The remaining handlers genuinely
// span deps — the next TKT-N0IKN9 slice.
//
// 25 → 27 (TKT-NU247U): [Server.ReloadDeps] and the unexported deps accessor.
// Both are the reload seam itself — ReloadDeps is the capability, and deps()
// is what makes every handler read the CURRENT snapshot instead of one baked
// in at construction. The six handler-group accessors that would also have
// landed here are free functions ([group], [setDeps], [bind]) precisely to
