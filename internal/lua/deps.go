// methods, which is exactly what the bindings call.
//
// The wiring site decides what backs it, and that decision IS the read-ACL
// (DEC-O59WM4): a visibility-backed adapter binds reads to the acting
// identity, while a plain store.Store satisfies it structurally for the
// operator-trust-boundary paths (CLI, docs runtime). Bindings therefore
// contain no ACL logic at all — they cannot forget to gate, because they
// have nothing else to read through.

// and rela.write_file are absent from the rela.* table on a reader.

	//
	// A nil VisibleReader DENIES (the binding raises); it never falls back
	// to a raw handle. A forgotten wiring must not become an ACL bypass
	// (RR-X9NVHI).
	//
	// There is deliberately NO second, raw store field beside this one.
	// rela.update_entity used to need one for its read-before-write — and
	// that field was a standing hazard, since pointing it at VisibleReader
	// by mistake made the save erase whatever the caller could not see.
	// The binding now builds an [entity.Patch] and lets the manager merge
	// against the raw stored entity internally (TKT-80EWGM), so no Lua
	// binding holds an ungated read path and the mistake is unavailable.
	// Elevated reads are the sole exception and stay explicitly opt-in via
	// [WriteDeps.ElevatedReader].

	// Tracer is the graph-traversal surface. Wiring injects either the
	// plain tracer or a visibility decorator over it; the trace bindings
	// are identical either way (they carry no properties, so gating is
	// purely node/title pruning inside the decorator).
	Tracer tracer.Tracer

	// Searcher produces search hits. NOTE: hits themselves are NOT gated —
	// rela.search hydrates each hit through VisibleReader and drops the
	// ones it cannot read, so no hidden entity or property reaches the
	// script. A timing/count residual remains (an attacker could infer that
	// *something* matched); that is the TKT-GGQ0JT class of oracle and is
	// tracked there, not silently ignored here.

	// Capabilities declares the ambient, non-graph capabilities a runtime

	//
	// The zero value grants NOTHING, which is the point: before this existed
	// every runtime on every surface held http, ai and the entire contents of
	// .rela/secrets.yaml, so any script could read a secret and POST it out in
	// two calls. A forgotten wiring must deny, exactly as a nil VisibleReader
	// denies rather than falling back to a raw handle (RR-X9NVHI).
	//
	// It lives on ReadDeps rather than WriteDeps because READ-only surfaces
	// (validation rules, document renders) had the same exposure — they cannot
	// mutate the graph, but they could still exfiltrate.
	//
	// Precedence: a NON-EMPTY [WithCapabilities] overrides this; an empty one
	// leaves it alone. Engine.execute passes that option unconditionally, so
	// treating an empty grant as a revocation silently erased this field for
	// every plain ExecuteCode/ExecuteFile caller — which is how the scheduler
	// runs. See the WithCapabilities godoc.

//
// Six methods — RenameEntity and UpdateRelation are intentionally
// absent because no Lua binding invokes them. Narrowed from the
// wider EntityManager interface in TKT-IF37 to drop lua's transitive
// dependency on internal/entitymanager.
//
// PatchEntity is what rela.update_entity is built on: the binding names
// the properties the script touched and nothing else, so it needs no raw
// store handle of its own to read-modify-write through (TKT-80EWGM).

//
// Why this exists rather than a string match: several hard errors embed
// caller-supplied values. An illegal state-machine transition formats the
// attempted value with %q, so `strings.Contains(err.Error(), "entity not
// found")` misreports a *rejected transition* as a *missing entity* when a
// script sets a property to that literal text — and a script branching on
// that message could try to recreate a row that still exists. Structural

	EntityManager Mutator

	// ElevatedManager, when non-nil, is a write handle whose mutations skip
	// the ACL deny (TKT-D8T148). It is set ONLY for an allow_acl_bypass
	// automation action.
	//
	// Since TKT-Y3JVFK it is no longer the sole key to rela.bypass_acl:
	// EITHER this or ElevatedReader registers the binding. What each handle
	// controls is which METHODS the `admin` table carries — with this nil the
	// write methods are absent entirely, so a reader-only elevation cannot
	// mutate. Both nil ⇒ no binding, and a script cannot elevate at all.
	ElevatedManager Mutator

	// ElevatedReader, when non-nil, is the RAW read handle backing the
	// admin.get_entity / list_entities / get_relations methods of the
	// bypass_acl closure (TKT-ACSBSA). Reads through it are unredacted and
	// ungated — the closure is the boundary, so a half-elevated read would
	// be a confusing contract.
	//
	// This is now the ONLY raw read handle a writer runtime can carry, and
	// it is opt-in. Previously a second raw field (WritePrepStore) was
	// present on EVERY writer runtime for update_entity's read-before-write;
	// removing it (TKT-80EWGM) means an ungated read path now exists only
	// where elevation was explicitly requested.
	//
	// It may be set WITHOUT ElevatedManager (TKT-Y3JVFK) — a READ-ONLY
	// elevation, which is how a document render aggregates over rows its
	// caller cannot see while remaining structurally unable to mutate (the
	// `admin` table simply has no write methods). On the cascade path both
	// handles are still set together, at the same site under the same two
	// conditions.
	//
	// Nil is a DENY, not a fallback: admin.get_entity raises rather than
	// silently reading through the gated VisibleReader. Elevation that
	// quietly degrades to the caller's view is worse than a loud failure —
	// the script would see a partial graph and treat it as complete.
	ElevatedReader EntityReader

	// ElevationRecorder, when non-nil, is notified once per bypass_acl
	// closure that performed at least one elevated READ (TKT-ACSBSA).
	//
	// Elevated WRITES are already audited inside entitymanager
	// (audit.OpACLBypass). Reads never reach entitymanager — they go
	// straight to the store — so without this an operator querying the
	// audit log for elevation sees every elevated write and is silently
	// blind to every elevated read. That asymmetry is the gap this closes.
	//
	// ONCE PER CLOSURE, not per read: a single admin.list_entities can
	// traverse the whole graph, and a per-row audit record would put an
	// unbounded synchronous write on a read path. The forensic question an
	// operator actually asks is "which elevated scopes read raw data", and
	// the closure is the unit of elevation.
	//
	// Nil disables recording. Unlike ElevatedReader, nil here is NOT a deny:
	// a wiring site may legitimately have no audit sink (CLI, tests), and
	// refusing to run automations because of that would be a worse failure
	// than an unrecorded read.
	ElevationRecorder ElevationRecorder
}

// ElevationRecorder receives a notification when a rela.bypass_acl closure
// used its elevated READ capability. Defined here at the consumer per

// binding needs; the wiring site adapts it onto the audit sink.
type ElevationRecorder interface {
	// RecordElevatedRead is called at most once per closure, after it
	// returns, when at least one elevated read occurred. bindings names the
	// distinct admin read methods used (e.g. "get_entity,list_entities") so
	// the record says what kind of access happened without recording the
	// data itself.
	//
	// Implementations must not block: this runs on the script's goroutine
	// inside the cascade. Errors are the implementation's to handle — the
	// binding has no way to surface them and a failed audit write must not
	// fail the automation.
