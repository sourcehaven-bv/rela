// mcpServices owns the per-project services the MCP process needs and

// receives a flattened [mcp.Deps] via [mcpServices.Deps] — it never
// holds a reference to this struct, so `internal/mcp` does not depend
// on this wiring code.
//
// The service stack (store, search, metamodel, entitymanager,
// automation, audit, validator, lua deps) is built by [appbuild] — the
// single composition root shared with rela-server and rela-desktop — so
// the MCP wiring is not a second composition root. Only the watcher
// adapter is MCP-specific (appbuild deliberately has no watcher story).
