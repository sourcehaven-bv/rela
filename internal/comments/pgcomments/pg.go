// Package pgcomments is the PostgreSQL-backed [comments.Store].
//
// It exists because the default backend is node-local. filecomments writes one
// YAML document per target under the project's .rela/ directory and scopes
// itself out of the multi-writer problem explicitly ("a cross-process writer is
// out of scope for this tier, exactly as it is for fsstore"). That is the right
// call for the filesystem and desktop tiers, where one process owns the
// project. It is the wrong one for the deployment docs/postgres-backend.md
// describes — several rela-server processes behind a load balancer sharing one
// database — because there a comment posted through one node simply does not
// exist for the others, and nothing reports an error.
//
// # Relationship to the store
//
// This package does NOT depend on internal/store, and that is enforced by
// arch-lint rather than convention. A comment is not graph content; routing it
// through the store would drag it into the audit log, version capture, search
// and /_schema, none of which are wanted for a note someone left on a field
// (see the internal/comments package doc).
//
// What it shares with the store is the CONNECTION POOL, injected by the
// composition root exactly as it is into pgstore.New and
// pgstore.NewSearchBackend. Three consumers, one pool, one owner — the
// alternative, opening a second pool against the same database, doubles a
// process's connection footprint to isolate packages that are already isolated
// by their imports.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// There is no mutex here. filecomments needs one because it read-modify-writes
// a whole document; this backend stores one ROW per comment, so concurrent adds
// to one target are independent inserts and the database serializes them.
// commentstest.RunConcurrencyTests pins that they all survive.
