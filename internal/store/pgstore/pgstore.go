// Package pgstore provides a PostgreSQL implementation of store.Store.
//
// # Connection ownership
//
// For the query path, pgstore does NOT own a connection or a DSN. New takes an
// injected [DBTX] handle — in production and in tests this is a *pgxpool.Pool.
// The wiring layer (internal/appbuild, behind //go:build postgres) builds the
// pool from the resolved DSN, runs [Migrate], and passes the pool here; it also
// owns closing the pool.
//
// A pool (not a single pgx.Tx) is required: the store opens its own
// transactions for multi-statement atomic operations (RenameEntity,
// cascade DeleteEntity) and must serve concurrent operations safely.
//
// # Change feed (cross-process)
//
// In addition to the injected query pool, a store opened via [Open] owns a
// change-feed listener (see feed.go / listener.go) holding its OWN dedicated
// connection, started in Open and stopped in Close. Each committed write emits
// a NOTIFY on the shared feed channel; the listener turns OTHER processes'
// notifications into store.Events on the same in-process Subscribe() fan-out as
// local writes, so multiple processes against one database see each other's
// changes. Store.Close stops the listener (closing its connection) before
// closing subscriber channels; it does not close the query pool.
//
// Event delivery is best-effort: a subscriber never sees an uncommitted write
// (emit and NOTIFY happen on/after commit), but it may MISS an event (full
// buffer, or a notification lost while disconnected). A seq-watermark catch-up
// recovers missed cross-process writes; consumers also re-snapshot. A store
// built with [New] (no listener wiring, e.g. the conformance harness) has only
// the in-process watcher.
//
// # Search
//
// The full-text search Backend lives in the same database (see search.go);
// the package doc on store.Store anticipates this ("smart backends ... provide
// native implementations sharing the same connection").

// Store is a PostgreSQL-backed store.Store.
//
// The exported surface is the mandated store.Store interface (a Required-interface
// exception, so its count tracks the interface size) plus two version seams that
// own or hand out lifecycle state and so stay here: StartVersionSweep (the store's
// own reconciliation goroutine, owning s.mu/s.sweep) and VersionStore (a one-line
// accessor handing out the versioning service over this store's shared pool).
// Content VERSIONING itself (entity + relation history reads, version writes,
// purge) is NOT here: it lives in [VersionStore], a separate service injected by
// the composition root, because a store "just stores" and versioning is a distinct
// concern that merely shares the same database (TKT-N0IKN9). That extraction
// dropped this struct from 40→33 exported / 53→41 total.
//
// Do NOT add version/history/purge methods back to *Store: they belong on
// [VersionStore], and re-adding one here would resurrect the type-assert-off-the-
// store pattern this refactor removed. Consumers reach versioning through the
// injected store.VersionService, never by asserting a capability on the store.
//
// +1 for ListEntityHeaders (TKT-1ESTYJ): the store.HeaderReader capability,
// which omits the content column from the SELECT so entity bodies never
// leave the database on scans that only read ids and properties. It belongs
// on *Store — unlike versioning, it is a plain read of the entities table,
// not a separate service — and the whole point is the backend-native
// projection, which cannot be delegated elsewhere.
//
// [Store.UserState] (TKT-CXD0A4) is +1 again, and is deliberately the SAME
// shape as [Store.VersionStore]: a one-line factory handing the shared pool to
// a separate type, called once by the composition root. The subsystem's API
// lives on [UserStateStore]; only the factory is here, so the count grows by
// one per subsystem rather than by its surface. Adding UserStateStore's nine
// methods to *Store is what the paragraph above forbids.
//
// EntityTypeWatermark ([store.TypeWatermark]) is +1 for the row-property
// reason, not the factory one: it reads `max(seq)` over this store's OWN
// entities and deletions rows — the same tables every other method here touches
// — so hoisting it into a service would mean a second handle over those two
// tables for a single index lookup.
//
// That makes TWO capabilities admitted as row-properties (ListEntityHeaders and
// EntityTypeWatermark). A THIRD should not raise these numbers again: extract
// the row-property reads together, the way versioning and user-state were
// extracted as subsystems.
//
// TryMigrationLock (TKT-CPCBR7) is +1 for the row-property reason too: it is
// a session advisory lock that must be pinned to a connection from THIS
// store's pool and schema-qualified with THIS store's schema — a lock handle
// hoisted into a service would still need exactly this pool, gaining a type
// but no separation.
