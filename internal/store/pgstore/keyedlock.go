// keyedLockClassKey namespaces the caller-keyed advisory locks, distinct from
// the migrate / reconcile / migration / sweep keys because advisory locks are
// database-GLOBAL.
//
// Unlike those four, the second slot of the two-key form is NOT
// hashtext(current_schema()) but a hash of (schema, caller key): the caller's
// key is the whole point, and the schema is folded into that hash so tenants
// sharing a database still do not exclude each other (the BUG-CA3VY0 class).
const keyedLockClassKey int64 = 0x52_45_4c_4b // "RELK"

// AcquireKeyedLock takes the schema-scoped advisory lock named key, BLOCKING
// until it is held or ctx is done.
//
// It is the cross-process half of the internal/lock seam: two rela-server
// processes against one database contend here, where an in-process mutex gives
// nothing. Consumers take the lock.Locker interface; this is the postgres
// implementation behind it.
//
// Blocking is the difference from every other advisory lock in this package.
// TryMigrationLock and the sweep use pg_try_advisory_lock and skip when another
// holder is active — right when the other holder is doing the same work.
// A keyed lock guards a caller's own critical section, so skipping would drop
// that caller's work; it waits instead, bounded by ctx.
//
// The lock is session-scoped and pinned to ONE pool connection held until
// release — handing it back earlier would silently void the guarantee (the
// sweep-tick rule). A leaked release is therefore also a leaked connection,
// which is why callers must defer it and pass a ctx with a deadline.
//
// This is an optional store capability discovered by type-assert, like
// Formatter and the version capabilities — not part of store.Store.
