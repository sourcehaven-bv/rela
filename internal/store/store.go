//
// # Why this exists
//
// The CalDAV collection tag (`getctag`) is polled by every client on every
// cycle, and computing it today renders the entire collection to hash the
// per-entry ETags — the exact work the tag exists to let clients SKIP. That is
// tolerable for a handful of configured collections and quadratic for
// graph-driven ones (one collection per project ⇒ P renders per poll).
//
// A watermark answers the same question with an index-only `max(seq)`.
//
// # Deletions are included, and that is load-bearing
//
// The value MUST account for hard-deleted rows. `max(seq)` over live rows alone
// can go DOWN when the newest row is deleted, and a tag that moves backwards
// makes a client that already saw the higher value stop polling — it is
// permanently stale with no way to notice. Implementations combine the live-row
// maximum with the deletion-tombstone maximum.
//
// # Type scope is deliberate, and over-triggers
//
// The watermark is scoped by entity TYPE only, never by a collection's filter or
// by the caller's ACL. A deletion tombstone records just (kind, id, type) — the
// deleted row's properties and relations are gone — so a narrower scope cannot
// be reconstructed once the row is removed.
//
// The consequence: any write to the type moves the watermark for every consumer
// of that type, and a client re-enumerates to discover nothing changed. That is
// the SAFE direction. A spurious re-sync costs one listing and self-corrects; a
// missed change strands a client forever. Do not "optimize" this into a
// per-collection or per-principal scope without solving the tombstone problem
