# MCP Server

Rela includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server
that exposes its full capabilities to AI assistants. This allows tools like Claude Code, Cursor,
and other MCP-compatible clients to query, create, and analyze entities and relations directly.

## Quick Start

Start the server manually (for testing):

```bash
rela mcp
```

### Claude Code Setup

**Option 1: `claude mcp add` (recommended)**

```bash
claude mcp add rela -s local -- /path/to/rela mcp
```

This stores the server configuration privately per-user per-project in `~/.claude.json`.

**Option 2: `.mcp.json` (for sharing via git)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rela": {
      "command": "rela",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Project-scoped servers defined in `.mcp.json` require interactive approval on first use.

> **Notes:**
>
> - Claude Code launches MCP servers with the project directory as cwd, so `rela mcp` finds
>   `schema.yaml` automatically — no cwd configuration is needed (or supported).
> - If both a local server and `.mcp.json` define `rela`, the local server takes priority.

The server communicates over stdio using JSON-RPC. It automatically discovers the project root
(by finding `schema.yaml`), loads the metamodel, and syncs the graph from markdown files.

## File Watching

The stdio server watches two things, for two different reasons. Both are debounced
with a 200ms window.

**`entities/` and `relations/`** — the store re-syncs the graph when files are created,
modified or deleted, so an external edit (a `git pull`, another tool, your editor) is
visible to the next read.

**`schema.yaml`** — the server reloads the schema in place. A restart is not needed
after adding an entity type, extending an enum, adding a `to:` target on a relation,
or changing a validation rule: the next tool call sees the new schema, `create_entity`
included.

The reload rebuilds the whole metamodel-derived stack — the validator, the entity
manager and its automations, transitions and computed properties — not just the
schema the read tools report. Refreshing only the read surfaces would leave writes
validating against the old schema, which is harder to diagnose than no reload at all.
The store and the search index are reused, so a schema edit costs no reindex and
loses none of the session's writes.

If the new schema does not parse, the server logs a warning and keeps serving the
last one that did. A save taken mid-edit is routinely unparseable and must not end
the session.

There is no `notifications/resources/list_changed` on either path. The resource SET
(a static list plus two URI templates) never changes at runtime, and the Go SDK emits
that notification only when the set changes. Clients re-read on demand and see current
data, because every read goes to the store.

## Tools

The tool set is kept small, because an MCP client may load the server into every
session and each tool costs context for its name, description and schema.
Related operations share one tool with a selector argument.

Results are compact JSON. Entity summaries carry a `title` resolved from the
type's `display_property`, so an agent can tell entities apart without
fetching each one. A summary of a faced entity also carries its `face`.

### Entity Tools

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `list_entities` | List entity summaries, sorted by ID | `type?`, `filter?`, `limit?` (default 50), `offset?`, `world?` |
| `list_worlds` | List the worlds the read tools accept, and which you may select | none |
| `show_entity` | Get one entity with its relations, and `other_faces` for a faced entity | `id`, `content?` (default true), `world?` |
| `search_entities` | Full-text search across entities | `query`, `type?`, `limit?` (default 20), `world?` |
| `create_entity` | Create an entity; a faced type needs `face` | `type`, `properties`, `content?`, `id?`, `face?` |
| `update_entity` | Update named properties or the body of one face | `id`, `properties?`, `content?` |
| `delete_entity` | Delete an entity, or one face of it as `ID@face` | `id`, `cascade?` |
| `rename_entity` | Change an entity's ID and its references | `id`, `new_id`, `dry_run?` |

`list_entities` answers `{"total":…,"has_more":…,"entities":[…]}`. An unknown
type is an error rather than an empty list.

**Filtering:** `filter` takes a predicate expression, the same language as the
CLI's `rela list --filter`. It requires `type`.

```text
entity.status == 'accepted'
entity.status == 'open' and entity.priority ~= 'low'
```

`related(...)` works too, and counts only the entities the caller may see:

```text
related(entity, 'implements', { status = 'open' })
```

In `update_entity`, a `null` property value removes the property, and an empty
string is ignored.

**Content states (faces) and worlds:**

An entity type can declare faces, such as `concept` and `adopted`. A world
picks one face per entity, in the order its `select:` names them.

- A bare id resolves through a world. Without `world`, both servers use the
  schema's default world, named by `default_world`.
- `ID@face`, such as `POL-001@concept`, reads that face in any world.
- `world` on `list_entities`, `search_entities` and `show_entity` reads in
  that world, so `world: "review"` lists what a `review` world selects.
  `list_worlds` names the worlds, their `select:` order, and whether you may
  select each one. A world you may not read is refused with an error.
- `show_entity` lists the entity's other faces you may read under
  `other_faces`, each with the `ref` that reads it.

The stdio server does not resolve other worlds. It accepts only the default
world's name.

`update_entity` writes one face. Its `id` may name it (`POL-1@draft`). A bare
id writes the one face the default world admits that the agent may read; when
there are several, the error lists them, for example
`POL-1 has faces; address one: POL-1@draft, POL-1@published`.

### Relation Tools

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `list_relations` | List relations | `type?`, `from?`, `to?`, `limit?` (default 50), `offset?` |
| `create_relation` | Create a relation between entities | `from`, `type`, `to`, `content?`, `properties?` |
| `delete_relation` | Delete a relation | `from`, `type`, `to` |

### Graph Tools

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `trace` | Walk the graph from an entity | `id`, `direction?` (`both` or `upstream`), `max_depth?` |
| `find_path` | Find the shortest path between two entities | `from`, `to` |

`direction: both` follows outgoing and incoming edges. `direction: upstream`
follows incoming edges only.

### Analysis

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `analyze` | Check the graph against the schema | `check`, `type?`, `threshold?` |

`check` is one of `cardinality`, `properties`, `validations`, `unique`, `orphans`
or `schema`. `type` applies to `orphans`, and `threshold` to `schema`. Findings
come back as `{"check":…,"count":…,"results":…}`; a clean check answers with one
sentence.

### Schema

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `schema` | Describe the schema | `type?` |

Without `type`, `schema` returns one short record per entity and relation type.
With an entity type it returns that type's properties (with enum values
resolved), the relations it takes part in, and its validation rules. With a
relation type it returns that relation's endpoints, cardinality and properties.
The full raw metamodel is the `rela://metamodel` resource.

### Lua Tools

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `lua_eval` | Run Lua code against the graph | `code` |
| `lua_run` | Run a script from `scripts/`; without `path`, list the scripts | `path?`, `args?` |

### Attachment Tools

These tools work on the files held by `file`-type properties. On a type with
faces, `id` is an address such as `POL-1@draft`, and each tool works on that
face only: a face lists and serves only its own files. A bare id reads the
face the default world selects. `attach_file` and `delete_attachment` write to
the one face the default world admits for a bare id; when it admits several,
the error names them so the agent can address one.

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `list_attachments` | List an entity's attached files with type and size | `id` |
| `read_attachment` | Return one file's content | `id`, `property`, `file_name` |
| `attach_file` | Attach a file to a file-type property | `id`, `property`, `file_name`, `content` |
| `delete_attachment` | Remove a file from a file-type property | `id`, `property`, `file_name?` |

**Reading.** `read_attachment` returns a file in one of three forms:

- PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP files are image content, when the bytes match the
  extension.
- Files with a `text/*` type (from the extension, or from the bytes when the
  extension is unknown) that are valid UTF-8 are text. HTML is returned as
  text too; it is never rendered.
- Anything else is a base64 blob with the URI
  `rela://attachment/{id}/{property}/{file_name}`, each segment URL-escaped.
  The blob keeps its MIME type only for PDF, JSON, plain text and CSV. Every
  other type, including SVG, is labeled `application/octet-stream`, because a
  client might render it.

Files larger than 10 MiB are refused.

**Writing.** `attach_file` takes the file as base64 in `content`. It does not
accept a local path. The limit is 16 MiB of decoded content. The rules are the
same as for a web upload:

- On a single-file property (`max: 1`), the new file replaces the current one.
- On a multi-file property, the file is added. A clashing name gets a numbered
  suffix, such as `report (1).pdf`. When the property is full, the call fails.
- The upload policy applies: the MIME allowlist, `scan_cmd` and transforms.
  See [attachment-security.md](attachment-security.md).
- A rejected upload is recorded in the audit log as `denied-write` with
  `op=attachment-write`.

`delete_attachment` may omit `file_name` when the property holds exactly one
file. Deleting a named file that is not there succeeds, says that nothing was
removed, and does not write the entity, so a retry is safe.

**Access control.** Every attachment tool first reads the entity through the
same ACL gate as `show_entity`:

- A hidden entity gets the same answer as a nonexistent one.
- A file property hidden by `visible:` is left out of `list_attachments`.
  Reading, attaching or deleting a file on it answers "attachment not found".
- `attach_file` and `delete_attachment` need `update` permission on the entity.
  rela checks this before it stores any bytes. A denied call is recorded in the
  audit log.

**Stdio differences.** `rela mcp` has no command sandbox runner. A property
with a configured `scan_cmd` or command transform therefore rejects every MCP
upload over stdio. `max_attachment_bytes` in `data-entry.yaml` applies only to
the remote transport; stdio uses the 16 MiB tool limit.

## Resources

Resources expose rela data as readable URIs.

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `rela://metamodel` | Full metamodel schema (JSON) |
| `rela://entity/{type}/{id}` | Single entity with properties and relations |
| `rela://relation/{from}/{type}/{to}` | Single relation. `{from}` is `ID` for an identity edge or `ID@face` for an edge from that face |

## Prompts

Prompts provide pre-built workflows that combine data retrieval with LLM instructions.

### analyze-traceability

Analyze traceability coverage for an entity. Returns the entity details, full trace tree
(upstream and downstream), and asks the LLM to evaluate completeness.

**Arguments:** `id` (required)

### review-orphans

Review orphan entities and suggest connections. Returns the list of orphans and available
relation types, then asks the LLM to suggest which relations should be created.

**Arguments:** `type` (optional, filter by entity type)

### summarize-project

Generate a project overview. Returns entity/relation counts by type, metamodel overview,
and analysis summary.

**Arguments:** none

### review-entity

Review an entity for completeness and quality. Returns the full entity, its property schema,
and validation results.

**Arguments:** `id` (required)

## Read gating (ACL)

MCP reads go through the same read-side ACL path as every other read shape.
The server does not hold a raw `store.Store`: it takes a narrow `GraphReader`
capability, and the wiring site supplies a visibility-wrapped reader that
resolves the principal from the call context. Row-level gating and field-level
`visible:` redaction therefore apply to MCP tools and resources exactly as they
do to the HTTP API — a hidden entity is absent, and a redacted property's value
is withheld.

The principal is stamped onto every tool-handler context by server middleware
and is required: `mcp.NewServer` returns an error rather than silently
degrading to an unauthenticated read. For `rela mcp` (stdio) the principal is
the OS user that launched the process, with `tool: "mcp"` — the same identity
recorded in the audit log below.

Because stdio MCP runs as a local user-launched process, this gating is
principally about consistency with the rest of the read paths rather than about
defending a network boundary. Serving MCP over HTTP is described in
[Remote MCP (over HTTP)](#remote-mcp-over-http) below.

See [acl-security.md](acl-security.md) for the read-path rules these wrappers
enforce.

## Remote MCP (over HTTP)

Everything above describes `rela mcp`, the **local stdio** transport. A
deployed `rela-server` can serve the same tools over HTTP so a hosted
assistant reaches your project without a local checkout.

It is **off by default**. Enable it with `-mcp` (or `RELA_MCP=1`):

```bash
rela-server -mcp \
  -jwt-issuer https://idp.example.com \
  -jwt-audience rela-prod \
  -jwt-jwks-url https://idp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

The endpoint is `POST /api/v1/_mcp`.

### The JWT flags are mandatory

`-mcp` **refuses to start** without `-jwt-issuer` / `-jwt-audience` /
`-jwt-jwks-url`. This is not a style preference:

An MCP client is not a browser and sends no `Origin`, so the endpoint has to
be exempt from the same-origin (CSRF) check the rest of `/api/` gets. That
exemption is only sound while rela verifies a bearer token *itself*. In
header-identity mode (`-principal-header`, or nothing at all) an
unauthenticated request resolves to the user `unknown` — combined with the
CSRF exemption that would be an unauthenticated, internet-reachable write
surface. Refusing at startup is the only place to catch it, because the
downgrade would otherwise show up per request, long after anyone reads the
startup log.

### What a remote caller can do

Exactly what their ACL grants — no more, and no less than the same person
gets through the web UI:

- Every read goes through the same ACL gate as `/api/v1/...`. Two callers
  hitting the same endpoint see different rows.
- Every write is authorized and audited as the **requesting** principal, with
  `principal.tool: "mcp"`.
- A denied entity is indistinguishable from a nonexistent one. This holds
  for writes too: a write naming an id you cannot read fails with the same
  "not found" error as an id that does not exist.
- `search_entities` returns only entities you may read, and drops a hit that
  matched only on a property hidden from you.

**The Lua tools are not available remotely.** `lua_eval`, `lua_run` and
`lua_list` exist only over stdio. A script is caller-supplied code that runs in
the server process, so offering it over HTTP would let any remote caller use
server CPU and memory at will. Every other tool is exposed remotely.

### Differences from stdio

- **Stateless.** Protocol revision `2026-07-28` removes sessions, and the
  Go SDK only reaches it in stateless mode. `GET` and `DELETE` return 405;
  only `POST` carries messages.
- **No file watcher.** Server→client notifications need a session, so the
  remote transport starts neither the store watcher nor the schema reload.
  Reads always see current data (every read hits the store), but a
  `schema.yaml` edit needs a restart here, unlike on stdio.
- **No IdP auto-discovery yet.** RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata is not
  served, and the 401 carries a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge only when your
  assertion header is literally `Authorization`. Point your client at the IdP
  by configuration.
- **Request size.** A request body may be up to about 22.3 MiB, enough for a
  16 MiB `attach_file` upload after base64 encoding. At most two requests
  larger than 4 MiB (or with no `Content-Length`) are processed at a time;
  the rest wait before their body is read, so concurrent uploads cannot
  exhaust memory. Smaller requests never wait. The same 22.3 MiB limit applies
  to one message over stdio.

## Audit log

Every entity / relation write performed through MCP tools (including
`lua_eval` and `lua_run` over stdio) is recorded in `.rela/audit/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
with `principal.tool: "mcp"`.

**Over stdio**, `principal.user` is the OS user that launched `rela mcp` —
*not* the LLM caller. The stdio protocol has no notion of "user", so the
host-process user is the right grain for forensics: "alice ran an
MCP-backed agent that did X".

**Over HTTP**, `principal.user` is the JWT-verified subject of the request,
so the record names the actual caller. Asserted roles and org are carried
too, exactly as for a web-UI write.

Filter for MCP-driven changes:

```bash
cat .rela/audit/*.jsonl | jq 'select(.principal.tool == "mcp")'
```

See [audit-log.md](audit-log.md) for the full record schema.
