# Comments: Annotating Entities, Fields and Text

Comments let people annotate an entity without changing it: a remark on a
property, on a view section, or on a selected range of the markdown body.

They are deliberately **not** part of your graph. A comment is a remark *about*
an entity, not a fact *in* your domain model, so comments live in their own
store with their own permissions — outside `store.Store`, outside the audit log,
outside `/api/v1/_schema`. That separation is what makes the author
**unforgeable**: rela owns the read and write path end to end, writes the author
from the request principal, and never reads it from the request body.

## Enabling comments

Commenting is off until you ask for it. Add a top-level `comments:` block to
`schema.yaml`:

```yaml
comments:
  enabled: true
  on: ["ticket", "feature"]
```

`on:` lists the entity types that accept comments. The wildcard `"*"` means
every type your project declares:

```yaml
comments:
  enabled: true
  on: ["*"]
```

An empty `on:` with `enabled: true` is a **load error**, not a silent
"everything" or a silent "nothing" — both readings are defensible, so rela
refuses to guess.

With no `comments:` block at all the feature does not exist: the routes answer
404, no storage directory is created, and `/api/v1/_schema` is byte-identical to
a rela built before commenting existed.

### Where comments are stored

Comments follow your storage backend, so they are always as portable and as
shareable as the entities they annotate.

| Backend | Comments live in |
|---|---|
| Filesystem (default) | one YAML file per target under `.rela/comments/` |
| SQLite | the `comments` table in `.rela/rela.db` |
| PostgreSQL | the `comments` table, in your tenant's schema |

On the filesystem backend they are diffable and hand-editable like the entities
beside them:

```text
.rela/comments/
  TKT-001.yaml
  TKT-001@draft.yaml
  FEAT-002.yaml
```

A target's whole thread lives in one file, so writes are atomic (temp file,
fsync, rename) — a torn write would otherwise lose a whole conversation rather
than one remark.

On the database backends each comment is a row. That is what makes commenting
work when **several `rela-server` processes share one database**: a file-backed
thread is written to whichever node served the request, so a comment posted
through one node would be invisible to every other, with no error to explain
it. Rows also mean two people commenting on the same entity at the same moment
are independent inserts rather than a read-modify-write of one document.

On SQLite the reason is portability rather than concurrency, since that tier is
single-process by design: a comment is a remark *about* content, so it belongs
in the file the content is in. Copy or ship `rela.db` and the commentary travels
with it.

Comments are never in your graph on any backend — no entity type, no audit log,
no `/_schema` (see below).

## Permissions

Six permissions, granted through a role's `permissions:` list exactly like the
`history:read` family:

| Permission | Grants |
|---|---|
| `comment:read` | See a target's comments |
| `comment:add` | Post a comment |
| `comment:update-own` | Edit or resolve your own comments |
| `comment:update-any` | Edit or resolve anyone's |
| `comment:delete-own` | Delete your own |
| `comment:delete-any` | Delete anyone's |

```yaml
roles:
  reviewer:
    read: ["ticket"]
    permissions:
      - comment:read
      - comment:add
      - comment:update-own
      - comment:delete-own

  editor:
    read: ["ticket"]
    permissions:
      - comment:read
      - comment:add
      - comment:update-any
      - comment:delete-any
```

`-any` implies `-own`. "Own" is a comparison of the stored author against the
requesting principal — rela has no `own` primitive in the graph, and comments
are not in the graph, so there is no edge to test.

Two rules are enforced and worth knowing:

- **`comment:read` is floored by the target's read verdict.** A principal who
  cannot read an entity cannot read its comments however the comment grants
  read, and cannot tell "no comments" from "not allowed" — the response is the
  same 404 a missing entity produces. Whether an entity exists stays a secret.
- **A mutating permission requires `comment:read`**, validated when `acl.yaml`
  loads. A role granting only `comment:delete-any` would let its holder remove
  comments it can never see. `comment:add` is exempt: write-only commenting is a
  coherent posture, the same way `create` is exempt from the entity write⊆read
  rule.

A permission conferred by an **ownership relation to the target** is honoured,
so "the assignee may comment on their own ticket" works without a special case.

### Identity is required

A comment is refused when the request has no resolvable identity, rather than
being stored as `unknown`. A comment nobody is recorded as having written could
never satisfy an `-own` check, so its author could neither edit nor delete it.

If you run rela-server without authentication, set `RELA_DATAENTRY_USER` or
point `-principal-header` at whatever your proxy injects.

## The three anchor kinds

### Property

Attaches to a named property. Drift-free by construction: a property name is a
*name*, not an offset, so it survives any edit to the entity.

In the UI, a small indicator sits beside each property label — a count when the
field has comments, a green check when they are all resolved, and a faint ⊕ on
hover when it has none.

### Section

Attaches to a view section by its operator-authored `sectionId` from
`data-entry.yaml`. Also a name, so also drift-free.

### Text range

Attaches to selected text in the markdown body. Select text, click **Comment**,
and the range renders highlighted.

This one anchors to content people can edit, so it works differently: rela
stores the quote plus its surrounding context (prefix, suffix, containing
sentence, nearest heading, paragraph index) and **re-locates it on every read**.
Byte offsets are never stored — an offset is invalidated by any edit earlier in
the body, and on the filesystem backend by a plain re-save, since rela reflows
markdown to 80 columns on write.

Consequences worth understanding:

- **A comment survives edits around it.** Insert a paragraph above the quoted
  text and the highlight still lands on the right words.
- **A comment on text that was edited away is reported detached**, never
  silently re-attached to something else. It still appears in the comments
  panel, flagged, showing what it was written about.
- **A match below the confidence threshold is flagged "may have moved"** rather
  than being presented as an exact location.

### Images and diagrams

An image or a mermaid/PlantUML diagram cannot be text-selected, so it gets its
own affordance: hover it and a comment button appears. Behind the scenes these
anchor to the block's markdown source, so they behave exactly like a text
anchor.

## Suggested changes

A text comment can carry a **suggested replacement**. Select text, click
**Comment**, then **Suggest a change**. The replacement box starts with the
markdown source of the selection, so formatting such as `**bold**` inside the
range is visible and kept unless you change it. An empty replacement suggests
deleting the text.

The thread shows the suggestion as removed and added text. Anyone who may edit
the entity sees an **Accept** button while the quoted text is still in the body.
Accepting does two things on the server:

1. It replaces the quoted text in the body. This is an ordinary entity write,
   so it is authorized, validated and audited like any other edit, under the
   name of the person who accepted.
2. It resolves the suggestion.

rela only applies a suggestion when it can locate the quoted text with
certainty. If the quoted text was edited, or rela cannot tell which of several
occurrences was meant, **Accept** is not offered and the server refuses with 409. The suggestion stays open, and you
can apply the change by hand.

Some limits apply:

- A suggestion can only replace text within one block. A selection that spans
  paragraphs, list items or headings can be commented on, but not replaced.
- The replacement cannot contain control characters (other than tab and
  newline), zero-width characters or text-direction overrides. These can hide
  what a change really does.
- The replacement cannot be edited after posting. To change it, delete the
  suggestion and post a new one.
- Accepting takes `comment:read` plus permission to update the entity.
  `comment:update-any` is not needed, even though accepting resolves someone
  else's comment.

## Comments are per content state

If your project uses [content states](content-states.md), comments belong to
**one face**. A remark on the draft ("this paragraph needs a source") is not a
remark on the published version, and would be misleading if shown there — the
published text may not even contain the quoted words.

The default face keeps the bare id, so a project that never uses faces sees
exactly the storage layout above, and comments written before you adopted faces
keep working unchanged.

## The HTTP surface

```text
GET    /api/v1/_comments/{type}/{id}              list a target's comments
POST   /api/v1/_comments/{type}/{id}              add one
PATCH  /api/v1/_comments/{type}/{id}/{commentID}  edit the body / resolve
DELETE /api/v1/_comments/{type}/{id}/{commentID}  remove one
POST   /api/v1/_comments/{type}/{id}/resolve      check whether a selection can be anchored
POST   /api/v1/_comments/{type}/{id}/{commentID}/accept  apply a suggestion and resolve it
```

A create body adds a suggestion with `anchor.replacement`. `resolve` returns
the selection's markdown source as `source_quote`. Each listed comment carries
`acceptable: true` when its suggestion can be applied to the current body.

`accept` returns the new body and any write warnings. It answers 409 when the
comment has no suggestion, is already resolved, or no longer matches the body
exactly. A refused or failed entity write reopens the comment.

Add a `@face` suffix to the id to address one content state:
`/api/v1/_comments/ticket/TKT-001@draft`.

`id` and `author` in a create body are **ignored** — the server mints the ID and
writes the author from the request principal. That is not a validation nicety:
accepting a client-supplied ID would let a caller overwrite someone else's
comment by reusing it.

## What comments deliberately do not do

- **No entity type.** Comments never enter `store.Store`, `entitymanager`, the
  audit log or `/_schema`. Accepting a suggestion writes the ENTITY, and that
  write is audited; the comment itself is not.
- **No versioning.** A comment's edit history is not kept.
- **No search indexing.** Comments are not returned by `/_search`.
- **No threading.** A reply is a separate comment sharing an anchor; they render
  together because they resolve to the same place.

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Comment body | 16 KB, no control characters except tab and newline |
| Comments per target | 500 |
| Anchored quote | 5 characters minimum, 2 KB maximum |
| Suggested replacement | 16 KB, one block of the quoted text |

The quote minimum exists because a shorter selection cannot be re-located
reliably — accepting one would mint a comment that detaches on the next edit.
